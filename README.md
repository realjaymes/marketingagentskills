# Marketing Agent Skills

AI agent skills for marketing tasks, built for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and similar AI coding assistants.

I'm [James](https://www.jamespraise.xyz). I'm a Product and Growth Marketing consultant with close to a decade of experience helping startups launch, scale, and grow with clarity and execution.

I am the founder of [Marketing In Action](https://marketinginaction.xyz), an execution-first marketing ecosystem for product marketers, growth marketers, founders, and GTM operators.

I've been a founding marketer multiple times, building marketing functions, teams, and systems from the ground up.

I've published more than 50 playbooks, templates, and practical breakdowns across product marketing, growth marketing, GTM engineering, AI, strategy, content, lifecycle, demand generation, and product-led growth. Everything I share is rooted in real execution, not theory.

I am currently experimenting with vibe coding, and this is one of the projects I'm building with that knowledge.

This repo is the Claude skills version of the [MIA Resources](https://marketinginaction.xyz/resources/) I have developed:

1. **Product Marketing Templates & Resources Library**: 50+ Product & Growth Marketing templates, frameworks, and resources to execute marketing with clarity.
2. **AI Prompt Frameworks & Templates for Marketers**: 50+ frameworks and templates that marketers and founders use to produce consistent, high-quality outputs from AI tools like ChatGPT Projects, Claude Projects, Gemini Gems, Custom GPTs & OpenAI Assistants.

These skills make it easier to unify and apply the knowledge and prompts from the knowledge files and custom GPTs/prompts.
