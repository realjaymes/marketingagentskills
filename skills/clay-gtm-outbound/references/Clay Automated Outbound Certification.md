Introduction
This rubric is designed to evaluate Clay table submissions for the Automated Outbound certification. It
provides a structured framework for assessing the quality, effectiveness, and implementation of best
practices in Clay tables used for outbound campaigns.
Use this rubric as a guide for your table ahead of time - and make sure you feel like the workbook you’re
submitting meets the standards listed here!
How to earn a certification
We’ll continue to release new courses and corresponding certifications every quarter - so stay tuned for
more!
Explore rubric and criteria
Clay table
● To earn a certification, you must submit a Clay table you’ve built that fits any of the certification
categories.
80%
● Passing score for each certification is ~80%, in addition to having met the critical factors for each
certification.
1 week
● Clay will take up to 1 week (often less) to evaluate your table according to the corresponding
rubric and criteria for that certification, and will update you on the status of your certification.
Understanding Clay Tables for Outbound
Clay tables for outbound campaigns represent the intersection of data enrichment, personalization, and
automated outreach. These tables leverage Clay's platform capabilities to:
1. Collect and enrich lead data from multiple sources
2. Segment leads based on relevant criteria
3. Generate personalized outreach content using AI and data points
4. Implement conditional logic to handle various scenarios
5. Integrate with outbound tools like email sequencers

The Outbound certification validates a user's ability to create Clay tables that effectively accomplish these
tasks while implementing best practices and innovative approaches.
How to Use This Rubric
Evaluation Steps
1. Review the submission - Examine the Clay table thoroughly, including all columns, formulas,
and workflows
○ Check table structure and organization
○ Review column names and data types
○ Examine formulas and AI prompts
○ Trace the workflow from data collection to outbound integration
2. Score each category - Assign a score from 0-5 for each of the 10 evaluation categories
○ Use the detailed criteria and examples for each category
○ Consider both technical implementation and strategic approach
○ Compare against examples provided in the rubric
3. Calculate weighted scores - Multiply each score by the category weight
○ Formula: Category Weighted Score = Category Raw Score × Category Weight
○ Example: A raw score of 4 in a category weighted 15% = 4 × 0.15 = 0.6 (or 12 points out
of 100)
4. Sum the weighted scores - Add all weighted scores to get the total score out of 100
○ Formula: Total Score = Sum of all Category Weighted Scores
○ Example: If all weighted scores sum to 83, the total score is 83/100
5. Check critical success factors - Ensure the submission meets minimum requirements in critical
areas
○ All three critical categories must score 3 or higher
○ Critical factors override numerical score in borderline cases
6. Determine final evaluation - Based on total score and critical factors, assign "Passed,"
"Almost!," or "Not Quite"
○ Passed: 80-100% with all critical factors met
○ Almost!: 65-80% with all critical factors met
○ Not Quite: Below 65% OR any critical factor below 3
7. Provide feedback - Document strengths and areas for improvement using the feedback template
Time Allocation Guide
For a thorough evaluation, allocate time as follows:
● Initial review of table structure and workflow: 15-20 minutes
● Detailed examination of implementation: 30-40 minutes
● Scoring and documentation: 15-20 minutes
● Feedback formulation: 15-20 minutes

Evaluation Framework
Submissions are evaluated across 10 categories, each weighted according to its importance. The overall
evaluation results in one of three outcomes:
● Passed (80-100%): Submission demonstrates excellence across most categories with no major
deficiencies
● Almost! (65-80%): Submission shows strong work but has 1-2 areas needing significant
improvement
● Not Quite (Below 65%): Submission has multiple areas requiring substantial improvement
Scoring Scale
Each category uses a consistent 0-5 scale:
Score Level Description
5 Very Strong Demonstrates complete mastery, meets all requirements
4 Strong Exceeds requirements with minor room for improvement
3 Satisfactory Meets basic requirements but lacks sophistication
2 Needs Improvement Shows understanding but has significant gaps
1 Insufficient Demonstrates minimal understanding or implementation
0 Missing No evidence of implementation
Critical Success Factors
Regardless of overall score, a submission must demonstrate at least satisfactory performance (3+) in
these critical areas to pass:
1. Personalization Depth and Relevance
○ Critical because personalization is the core purpose of using Clay for outbound
○ Without effective personalization, the table fails its primary objective
2. Email Construction Methodology
○ Critical because modular, component-based construction is essential for flexibility and
quality
○ Single-block generation severely limits effectiveness and adaptability
3. Error Handling and Conditional Logic
○ Critical because professional outreach requires handling missing or incomplete data
○ Without proper error handling, outputs can be unprofessional or nonsensical

These factors are non-negotiable foundations of effective Clay tables for outbound. Even if a submission
scores well in other areas, failing in these critical areas indicates fundamental issues that must be
addressed.

Common Pitfalls to Avoid
Based on improvement suggestions from previous submissions:
1. Single-block email generation - Instead of generating entire emails in one AI call, break them
into components
2. Missing conditional logic - Always implement logic to handle missing fields
3. Insufficient personalization - Go beyond basic personalization to make a meaningful
connection
4. Lack of segmentation - Use enrichments to segment leads and tailor messages accordingly
5. Unused data - Ensure all collected data is effectively utilized in the workflow
6. Adding leads without validation - Always validate leads before adding to campaigns
7. Non-human readable output - Ensure final output sounds natural and professional
8. Inadequate fallback mechanisms - Provide fallbacks for all potential missing data
9. Poor copywriting - Apply good copywriting principles to all output
10. Disconnected workflow - Ensure all parts of the workflow connect logically
