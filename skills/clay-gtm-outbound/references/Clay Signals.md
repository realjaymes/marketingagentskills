Clay Signals
Even sophisticated prospecting workflows are still reactive. You're finding companies that fit your ICP, but
you're not catching them at the right moment when they're actually ready to buy.
Real-time signal detection transforms your GTM motion from reactive prospecting to proactive opportunity
capture.
What Are Signals?
Signals are dynamic monitoring systems that detect buying intent in real-time. Think of them as your
always-on radar system, constantly scanning the market for companies showing signs they might need
your product or service.
The Timing Problem
In B2B sales, timing is everything. You can have perfect product-market fit, compelling value propositions,
and a great sales team, but if you reach out at the wrong time, none of that matters.
Signals solve this by identifying the exact moment when a company transitions from not needing your
solution to actively looking for one. Instead of hoping you catch prospects during their buying window,
you're systematically monitoring for the business events that create those windows.
The Evolution of Signal Detection
GTM teams have approached timing in three distinct eras:
Era 1: Manual Research – Sales reps spent hours scrolling LinkedIn, reading company blogs, and
setting up Google alerts. Time-intensive, inconsistent, and couldn't scale beyond 20-30 accounts.
Era 2: Intent Data – Companies bought lists of accounts searching for relevant keywords. Better than
manual, but still reactive—by the time someone's searching, they're already evaluating multiple
competitors.
Today: Automated Intelligence – With Clay, we're proactively monitoring for business events that create
needs before prospects even realize they should be evaluating solutions.
The Four Categories of B2B Signals
Intent Signals
Companies researching your category, visiting competitor websites, or downloading relevant content.
These are valuable but late-stage— it’s likely that prospects are already comparing and evaluating
solutions.
Growth Signals
Marketing Newsletter | Marketing Resources | Marketing Services

James Praise | Marketing In Action
Companies scaling rapidly, creating immediate needs for new tools:
● Funding announcements indicating new budget
● Aggressive hiring patterns requiring new systems
● New office openings suggesting expansion
● Significant web traffic increases needing support
Change Signals
Transitions that create new needs and disrupt existing vendor relationships:
● Leadership changes, especially new CMOs, CTOs, or VPs of Sales
● Technology migrations showing active infrastructure investment
● Organizational restructuring indicating strategic shifts
● New business line launches requiring supporting technology
Distress Signals
Challenges that create urgency and openness to change:
● Negative reviews mentioning specific pain points
● Compliance violations creating immediate pressure
● Public complaints about current vendors
● System outages revealing infrastructure problems
Why Signals Matter More Than Ever
Three major shifts make signal-based GTM essential:
Market Saturation: B2B buyers have more options than ever. When features and pricing are
commoditized, timing becomes your biggest differentiator.
Buyer Behavior Transformation: Buyers do extensive self-service research before talking to sales,
expect personalized omnichannel experiences, and involve more stakeholders in longer, more complex
sales cycles.
Rising CAC and Budget Pressure: Traditional spray-and-pray approaches are economically
unsustainable. GTM teams need surgical precision, focusing on highest-probability opportunities.
The shift is clear: from reactive (waiting for prospects to raise their hand) to proactive (anticipating when
need is created).

Real-World Example: Vanta
Vanta built a sophisticated signal system that monitors for business events creating the need for SOC2
certification:
● Funding announcements: Newly funded companies often need compliance certifications to close
enterprise deals
● Hiring patterns: Specifically companies hiring security engineers or compliance officers
● AI content analysis: Analyzing communications and job postings for organizations seeking SOC2
certification
Result: Vanta reaches out at the exact moment prospects realize they need compliance
automation—often before they know solutions like Vanta exist or have begun evaluating alternatives.
Real-World Example: Canva
Canva monitors social media for visual content showing brand inconsistencies. Their AI analyzes posts
for:
● Inconsistent fonts across materials
● Off-brand colors
● Poorly aligned logos
● Spacing and layout issues
When they identify brand consistency problems, they automatically reach out to heads of brand or
design—often within hours of the problematic content being posted. They're engaging at the exact
moment the problem is top-of-mind, with concrete examples.
Exercise: Identify Your Signal Opportunities
Brainstorm all potential signals relevant for your product or service. Consider:
● Intent Signals: What actions indicate a readiness or desire to purchase your product?
● Growth Signals: What happens when companies scale that creates demand for your solution?
● Change Signals: What transitions or shifts create new needs?
● Distress Signals: What problems does your product solve that might be publicly visible?
Create Your Prioritization Matrix
Plot your signals on two dimensions:
Marketing Newsletter | Marketing Resources | Marketing Services

James Praise | Marketing In Action
● Frequency: How often does this signal occur in your target market?
● Conversion Potential: How likely is this signal to result in a sale?
Signals scoring high on both frequency and conversion potential are your golden opportunities—prioritize
these as you build your signal detection systems.
Key Takeaways
Signals transform GTM from reactive prospecting to proactive opportunity capture by detecting buying
intent in real-time. The four signal categories—intent, growth, change, and distress—each reveal different
types of buying opportunities.

Market saturation, buyer behavior changes, and rising CAC make signal-based GTM essential rather than
optional. The competitive advantage now comes from better timing—reaching prospects at exactly the
right moment.
With Clay, you can build sophisticated automated systems that detect the specific signals that matter for
your business, catching companies before they even realize they need to evaluate solutions.

Types of Signals in Clay
Default Signals: Your GTM Intelligence on Autopilot
Clay handles the data sources, refresh rates, and filtering logic so you get enterprise-grade monitoring
without setup complexity.
● Career Movement Signals: Track VP-level job changes, new hires, promotions, layoffs, and
relocations across your target accounts. When your champion moves companies or a key
decision maker joins a prospect account, you'll know within hours rather than discovering it weeks
later through manual LinkedIn checks.
● News and Fundraising: Monitor funding rounds, mergers and acquisitions, strategic
partnerships, product launches, and leadership changes. These events create immediate
opportunities—new budget from funding, tool evaluation during M&A integration, or fresh
perspectives from new executives.
● Job Postings: Reveal expansion signals that predict buying behavior. Aggressive sales or
marketing hiring indicates budget allocation and growth ambitions. Technical role postings show
technology adoption plans and infrastructure investment. Clay analyzes job descriptions for
urgency indicators and geographic expansion signals.
● LinkedIn Brand Mentions: Monitor competitor discussions, partnership opportunities, customer
satisfaction signals, and thought leadership trends. This is social listening purpose-built for B2B
sales intelligence, helping you identify prospects actively engaging with your category or
expressing dissatisfaction with current solutions.
● Website Intent: Monitor page visits, content engagement, resource downloads, and pricing
interactions for real-time buying signals. This reveals which accounts are actively researching
solutions and how deep they are in their evaluation process.
● Customer Sentiment Analysis: Monitor reviews on G2, Capterra, and TrustRadius for
competitive insights, feature requests in your category, and churn indicators from competitors'
customers. This reveals prospects who might be open to switching solutions.
Practical Example: Marketing Automation
Let's say you sell marketing automation software. You'd set up a Default signal for job postings, filtering
for companies hiring Marketing Operations Managers or Demand Generation roles. When a company
posts these positions, it often signals they're scaling their marketing function and evaluating new tools.
The signal fires, you get notified, and you can reach out with messaging about how your platform helps
growing marketing teams scale efficiently. The timing is perfect because they're actively thinking about
their marketing infrastructure and likely evaluating technology to support their expansion.

Custom Signals: Build Monitoring for Anything
Custom signals combine scheduled sources, AI analysis, and conditional logic to monitor virtually
anything that matters for your specific market. This is where you build proprietary intelligence systems
that competitors can't easily replicate.
Example Monitoring Categories
● Tech Stack Changes: Detect adoption of any technology—CRM migrations, marketing
automation implementations, security tool deployments, cloud platform switches. Each change
represents an opportunity to offer complementary solutions or competitive alternatives.
● Compliance and Certifications: Monitor regulatory requirements, newly achieved certifications
like SOC2 or HIPAA, and industry standards adoption. These events often trigger evaluation of
related tools and services.
● Geographic Expansion: Identify new office openings, market entry signals, international hiring
patterns, and localization efforts. Expansion creates needs for infrastructure, compliance, and
operational tools.
● Website Content Monitoring: Track pricing modifications that suggest positioning changes,
feature updates revealing product evolution, team page additions indicating growth, and blog
themes showing strategic focus. These changes reveal company priorities and potential needs.
● Social Media Activity: Monitor executive LinkedIn posting patterns, company engagement levels
with industry content, event participation showing active community involvement, and thought
leadership themes revealing strategic priorities.
● Financial Filings Intelligence: Analyze SEC filings for revenue guidance changes, executive
compensation patterns indicating strategic shifts, and strategic announcements about new
markets or product lines. Public companies telegraph their priorities through regulatory filings.
● Engineering Density Metrics: Monitor GitHub activity levels, technical job postings, open source
contributions, and developer community engagement. High engineering density often predicts
technology adoption and infrastructure investment.
These are just scratching the surface of what's possible using custom signals. Any data source in Clay
can become a signal. You're not limited to pre-built options—if Clay can enrich for it, you can monitor for
changes in it. This flexibility enables monitoring for highly specific criteria that matter uniquely to your
business.
Real-World Example: Vanta
Vanta uses AI signals to identify companies actively seeking SOC2 certification, then reaches out with
compliance automation messaging. They analyze website content, job descriptions, and social media to
identify certification intent before it becomes obvious through public announcements.
Marketing Newsletter | Marketing Resources | Marketing Services

James Praise | Marketing In Action
This early detection allows them to engage prospects during the research phase rather than the vendor
evaluation phase, shaping the conversation and building relationships before competitors enter the
picture.
Technical Capabilities
Custom signals leverage Clay's full technical stack:
● API integrations for real-time data feeds
● Web scraping for content monitoring
● RSS feeds for news and blog tracking
● Database change detection for internal systems
Choosing the Right Signal Type
Now you understand the signal types that power Clay's monitoring engine. The key is matching signal
type to your specific use case through a simple decision framework.
Decision Framework
● Start with Default Signals for common GTM triggers like job changes, funding rounds, or hiring
patterns. These battle-tested signals work out of the box and cover the scenarios that drive
results for most businesses.
● Build Custom Signals when you need to continuously monitor data points that aren't available in
pre-built options. If your competitive advantage comes from detecting subtle patterns or
combining multiple data points, custom signals let you build proprietary continuous opportunity
detection systems.
The most sophisticated GTM teams layer multiple signal types and enrichments. They might use Default
signals for career changes and Custom signals for AI-powered content analysis—all working together to
create comprehensive market intelligence.
Key Takeaways
Clay offers different signal types designed for different monitoring needs: Default signals provide pre-built
monitoring for common GTM triggers and Custom signals enable sophisticated monitoring with AI and
complex logic.
Default signals give you immediate value without configuration complexity, covering the business events
that most reliably predict buying intent. Custom signals create competitive advantages through proprietary
intelligence that competitors can't easily replicate.

Setting Up Signals in Clay
Three Ways to Access Signals
Method 1: The Signals Dashboard
This is your main control center. Log into Clay and click Signals in the left menu. Here you can see all
active signals, check performance metrics, and create new ones with the New Signal button. You'll use
this dashboard to manage signals—track credit usage, monitor results, and adjust settings across all your
monitoring systems.
Method 2: From Inside Any Table
When working in a table, click Actions in the toolbar. You'll see signal options like "Monitor for job
changes" or "Track hiring activity." This method uses your existing table data as the starting point,
making it ideal when you already have a list of companies or contacts to monitor.
Method 3: From Your Homepage
Create a new workbook and select a signal option from the left menu.
All three methods follow the same configuration process—choose whichever fits your workflow best.
A. Setting Up Job Change Signals
Job changes convert exceptionally well because they represent major professional transitions that often
include budget authority, strategic planning, and openness to new vendor relationships.
Configuration Steps
Select Job Change from your signal options. Choose your data source—CRM import, CSV upload, or
existing Clay table containing the contacts you want to monitor.
Required Data Fields
● LinkedIn Profile URLs: Clay uses these to watch for job changes. If you don't have LinkedIn
URLs in your data, use Clay's enrichment tools to find them before setting up the signal.
● Company Domains or Company LinkedIn URLs: This helps Clay distinguish between
someone changing companies versus getting promoted at the same company.
Monitoring Scope
The quality of your job change signals depends on monitoring the right people. Focus on champions
who've bought from you before, decision-makers at target accounts, or competitors' customers who might
be open to switching when they change roles.
Marketing Newsletter | Marketing Resources | Marketing Services

B. Setting Up New Hire Signals
New hire signals work exceptionally well for account-based prospecting, allowing you to engage new
decision-makers before they've established vendor relationships.
Targeting Configuration
Select "New Hires" and set your targeting rules to focus on the right opportunities:
● Company Size: Define parameters like 50-500 employees for mid-market companies, or 1000+
for enterprise accounts, based on your ICP.
● Job Title Keywords: Add relevant titles like "CMO," "VP Marketing," or "CTO" based on who
typically makes buying decisions for your solution.
● Location Filters: Set geographic boundaries matching your sales territory or service area. This
prevents wasting resources on opportunities you can't effectively serve.
● Time Window: Set how recent hires should be. Find a good balance—recent enough to be
relevant but not so narrow that you miss opportunities.
Provide company domains or LinkedIn company URLs for accounts you want to monitor. The more
companies you include, the more potential signals you'll capture—but ensure they align with your ICP to
maintain signal quality.
Layering on Enrichments
Signals become truly powerful when you add automatic enrichments that transform raw alerts into
actionable intelligence.
● Contact Enrichments: Find new email addresses and phone numbers so you can reach out
immediately without manual research.
● Company Enrichments: Gather tech stack information, funding details, and employee counts to
inform your messaging and qualification.
● AI Research: Analyze the company's website, recent news, and industry position to generate
personalized talking points for your outreach.
Operationalizing Signal Results
Clay offers several options for routing signal results to your team. Here are some examples:
● Send to New Tables: Generate a dedicated table for each signal type. This keeps different signal
categories organized and makes it easy to track performance by signal type.
● Add to Existing Tables: Append results to tables you're already using.
Marketing Newsletter | Marketing Resources | Marketing Services

James Praise | Marketing In Action
● Send to Slack: Send automated alerts to Slack channels so that your reps can act on signals in
real time
● Webhooks: Send data to other systems in real-time for advanced automation scenarios.
● CRM Push: Route results straight into Salesforce or HubSpot, creating records automatically with
enriched data already populated.
Run Frequency
Run frequency depends on how time-sensitive your signals are and how quickly you can act on them.
Daily Runs: Ideal for job changes and critical account monitoring where timing matters significantly.
Catching someone within days of a job change is far more valuable than reaching out months later.
Weekly Runs: Work well for market research and broader trend monitoring where immediate action isn't
critical.
Monthly Runs: Suitable for industry analysis and long-term strategic intelligence gathering.
More frequent runs catch opportunities faster but consume more credits. Balance responsiveness with
budget by matching frequency to your actual sales velocity.
Dashboard Management
The Signals dashboard is your control center for monitoring and optimizing your signal systems.
Key Metrics
Track active signals across your organization, performance metrics including credits used and results
generated, and run status to ensure signals are executing on schedule.
Ongoing Optimization
Signals are flexible and should evolve with your strategy. Click any signal name to edit targeting criteria,
change enrichment selections, or update alert preferences.
You can pause signals without losing your configuration, which helps when adjusting strategy or
managing credit consumption during budget planning.
Performance Tracking
Monitor signal effectiveness over time:
● Credit Usage: Understand the cost per signal relative to the value it generates
● Result Quality: Track how many results turn into actual opportunities
● Optimization: Adjust frequency or targeting based on conversion data

Best Practices for Signal Success
Start small and grow strategically rather than launching dozens of signals at once.
Quality Over Quantity
One well-configured signal generating high-quality results beats five signals creating noise that your team
ignores. Focus on the signals that directly support your highest-priority GTM motions.
Choose the Right Signal Type
● Company Monitoring: Best for account-based approaches where you're tracking specific target
accounts for buying signals.
● Contact Monitoring: Ideal for relationship selling where champions and decision-maker
movements create opportunities.
Create Standard Follow-Up Processes
The best signal is useless if nobody acts on it. Before launching signals, define:
● Who gets notified when signals trigger
● What actions they should take
● Expected response timing
● How to measure signal-to-opportunity conversion
Without clear processes, even perfect signals won't drive revenue.
Troubleshooting Common Issues
When signals aren't performing as expected, systematic troubleshooting helps identify and fix the root
cause.
● Signal Not Triggering: Check required fields first—ensure you have clean LinkedIn URLs and
complete company domains. Verify that targeting isn't too narrow; sometimes slightly broader
parameters help establish baseline signal volume before optimizing.
● False Positives: If you're getting irrelevant results, tighten your filters by adding more qualifying
conditions. Clay's AI can improve signal quality by learning from your feedback about which
results are valuable.
Success comes from iteration and continuous improvement. Start with basic configurations, observe what
works, and refine based on actual results. Signals become more valuable as you optimize them for your
specific needs and market.

Key Takeaways
Setting up signals requires choosing the right access method, configuring targeting criteria, and enabling
automatic enrichments that transform alerts into actionable intelligence.
Run frequency should match your sales velocity. The dashboard provides ongoing performance tracking
and optimization capabilities.
Start small with one high-quality signal, create standard follow-up processes, and iterate based on
conversion data. Quality signals with clear workflows always outperform numerous signals without proper
operationalization.

Building Custom Signals in Clay
While your competitors track the same default signals like job postings and funding announcements,
custom signals let you monitor the unique data points that actually predict buying behavior in your specific
market.
What Are Custom Signals?
Custom signals are user-defined monitoring systems that track any data point relevant to your business,
turning unique insights into automated buying signals.
You can turn anything—any integration, any source in Clay—into a signal, as long as it's digitally
accessible.
Why Custom Signals Transform GTM
Identify Opportunities Competitors Miss
Custom signals let you spot opportunities competitors either completely overlook or have no structured
way of monitoring at scale. While they rely on standard intent data everyone can buy, you're detecting
signals unique to your understanding of the market.
Unlock industry-Specific Insights
Monitor data points that only matter in your vertical—compliance certifications, regulatory changes,
industry-specific events that generic signal providers would never track because they serve broad
markets.
Track Your Unique Buying Patterns
Instead of relying on generic intent signals based on aggregate data, monitor the specific behaviors that
predict purchases in your business based on your actual closed-won analysis and customer research.
Categories of Custom Signals
1. Social Listening Signals
LinkedIn: Track brand mentions, competitor discussions, post engagement patterns, and profile changes
revealing job movements or strategic shifts.
X/Twitter: Monitor hashtag conversations, sentiment analysis around your category, and executive
activity showing thought leadership or strategic focus.
Reddit/Slack: Access subreddit and slack channel discussions, pain point mentions in relevant
communities, and product comparisons revealing consideration behavior.
Marketing Newsletter | Marketing Resources | Marketing Services

James Praise | Marketing In Action
2. First-Party Data Signals
Turn your own operational data into buying signals by monitoring internal systems:
Product Usage: Connect Snowflake or your data warehouse to track usage patterns, feature adoption
rates, and engagement declines that predict churn or expansion.
Gong Conversations: Analyze call topics, specific pain points mentioned repeatedly, and competitor
mentions revealing consideration of alternatives.
3. Tech Stack Change Signals
Track technology adoption and migration that creates immediate integration and replacement
opportunities:
● New tool adoptions showing budget allocation and infrastructure investment
● Platform migrations like CRM changes creating tool evaluation cycles
● Competitor tool removals opening displacement opportunities
● Stack expansions when companies add entire new technology categories
4. Web Content Change Signals
Monitor website updates that reveal strategic shifts and priorities:
● Homepage messaging changes showing repositioning
● Pricing page updates indicating market strategy shifts
● Team page additions when new executives join
● Product page feature additions revealing roadmap priorities
● Blog content themes showing strategic focus areas
● Case study publications indicating target market evolution
5. Compliance and Certification Signals
Track regulatory and security achievements that often trigger related technology purchases:
● New security certifications like SOC2, ISO, or PCI compliance
● Compliance badges added to websites signaling achievement
● Regulatory filings revealing compliance investments
● Industry-specific accreditations opening new market opportunities
Marketing Newsletter | Marketing Resources | Marketing Services

James Praise | Marketing In Action
6. RSS Feed and News Monitoring
Systematically track public announcements and news:
● Industry news publications for category-wide trends
● Regional news at county level for local businesses (construction, real estate)
● Regulatory announcements affecting your target market
● Patent filings showing innovation investment
● Conference announcements revealing industry participation
● Press releases about partnerships, products, or expansions
7. Unique Industry Signals
These are vertical-specific signals that only make sense in your context. Here are some examples:
Trucking Safety: One customer tracks truck incidents like jackknifes across the US on an hourly basis,
using real-time data to immediately reach out to companies needing safety solutions right after incidents
occur.
Warehouse Staffing: Another customer discovered their number one predictive data point was "how
many parking spaces a warehouse has"—which correlates directly with staffing needs and facility size.
These create un-replicable competitive advantages because they're based on deep domain expertise
competitors don't have.
Building Custom Signals
Step 1: Identify Your Signal Opportunity
Ask your sales and customer success teams four key questions that reveal what actually predicts buying:
● What data points do you manually research before outreach?
● What changes at accounts trigger buying conversations?
● What patterns do you see consistently in closed-won deals?
● What information makes you say "we should reach out now"?
Signal Validation Checklist
Before building a custom signal, validate the opportunity:
● Is this data publicly available or in our systems?
Marketing Newsletter | Marketing Resources | Marketing Services

James Praise | Marketing In Action
● Does this change frequently enough to be actionable?
● Does this correlate with buying intent or churn risk?
● Can we act on this signal within 24-48 hours?
● Is this unique to our business and not tracked by competitors?
If you answer yes to all five, you've identified a strong custom signal candidate.
Step 2: Choose Your Data Source
Select the right technical approach based on your data type and structure:
● Web Scraping with Claygent/Apify: Best for website content, public data, and unstructured
information that requires interpretation.
● API Integrations: Optimal for structured data from platforms like HG Insights, TrustRadius, or
any service with documented APIs.
● RSS Feeds: Perfect for news, blogs, regulatory filings, and press releases that publish via
standard feeds.
● First-Party Data: Connect your Snowflake or data warehouse (Enterprise plans) for product
usage, engagement metrics, and support data.
● Social Listening: Use native Clay integrations for brand mentions, competitor discussions, and
sentiment analysis across social platforms. You may also explore social listening tools like
sensorhub.ai or trigify.io for this use case.
Step 3: Design Your Monitoring Logic
Define trigger conditions that determine when signals should fire:
● Binary Triggers: Simple yes/no conditions like "new certification appears on website" or
"competitor mentioned in press release."
● Threshold Triggers: Activate when values cross specific levels like "engagement drops below
50%" or "hiring rate exceeds 10 roles/month."
● AI-Powered Triggers: Use Claygent to analyze content for sentiment, specific topics, or complex
patterns that require interpretation.
● Combination Triggers: Require multiple conditions like "funding AND new hire AND competitor
mention" for higher-quality signals.
Step 4: Set Your Monitoring Cadence
Match your checking frequency to signal urgency and actionability:
Marketing Newsletter | Marketing Resources | Marketing Services

James Praise | Marketing In Action
● Real-Time Webhooks: Product usage events, form submissions, and critical alerts where
immediate action drives value.
● Hourly Monitoring: High-urgency signals like safety incidents or data breaches where timing
creates competitive advantage.
● Daily Monitoring: Social media, news, and website changes for standard signal monitoring with
reasonable response windows.
● Weekly/Monthly: Tech stack changes, compliance audits, and annual report analysis for
long-term strategic intelligence.
Best Practices
Start with Manual Research Automation
The fastest path to valuable custom signals is automating what your team already does manually. What
do they research before every sales call? What data do they look up when qualifying prospects?
Automate that first.
Match Cadence to Urgency
Don't over-monitor low-urgency signals or under-monitor time-sensitive opportunities. Real-time
monitoring should be reserved for signals where hours matter.
Layer Signals for Higher Intent
Combine custom signals with default signals for better qualification. A company that just hired a new
CMO (default signal) AND published a blog post about marketing infrastructure challenges (custom
signal) represents far higher intent than either signal alone.
Track and Optimize Performance
Measure conversion rates from different signals to understand which actually predict buying. Adjust
triggers based on false positive rates. Refine messaging for different signal types based on response
data.
Key Takeaways
Custom signals are your competitive advantage, allowing you to monitor what competitors can't access or
don't think to track. Any data source can become a signal through web scraping, APIs, RSS feeds,
first-party data, or social listening.
In our next lesson, we'll show you how to stack multiple signals together to create sophisticated
qualification systems that identify the highest-intent prospects with precision. We'll cover signal scoring,
combination logic, and how to avoid alert fatigue while maximizing signal quality.

Advanced Strategies with Signals
Understanding Signal Orchestration
What is Signal Orchestration?
Signal orchestration, also known as "signal stacking," is the practice of combining multiple signals to
create a holistic view of prospect intent. A single signal—like a pricing page visit—provides limited
context. But when you layer that visit with recent funding news, a competitor mention on LinkedIn, and a
new revenue team hire, you're no longer guessing at intent. You're observing a pattern that indicates real
buying momentum.
The challenge most teams face is treating signals like separate, disconnected events. They might notice
that someone downloaded a whitepaper, but they miss the bigger picture: that same prospect also
attended a webinar, visited the pricing page twice, and their company just posted a job opening for a role
that typically uses your product.
Each signal alone is interesting; together, they tell a compelling story about readiness to buy.
🔄
Fundamental Approaches to Multi-Signal Processing
Sequential Processing: The Journey-Based Approach
Sequential processing means signals must occur in a specific order before triggering action. You're
essentially mapping signals to a defined buyer journey. For example, you might only trigger outreach after
a prospect:
1. First engages with educational content
2. Then visits your website
3. Finally downloads a resource
This works well when you have a clear, predictable buyer journey and want prospects to demonstrate
progression through specific milestones.
Parallel Processing: The Threshold-Based Approach
Parallel processing takes a different philosophy. Instead of requiring a specific sequence, you monitor
multiple signals simultaneously and take action when any combination reaches a predetermined
threshold. A prospect might trigger outreach by hitting three out of five possible signals, regardless of the
order in which they occurred.
This approach captures more opportunities and is more flexible in accommodating non-linear buyer
journeys. However, it requires more sophisticated scoring mechanisms to avoid false
positives—prospects who appear engaged but aren't actually ready to buy.
Marketing Newsletter | Marketing Resources | Marketing Services

James Praise | Marketing In Action
The Hybrid Approach: Best of Both Worlds
Most successful GTM teams don't choose one approach exclusively. Instead, they use parallel processing
for initial qualification (casting a wider net to identify potentially interested prospects) and then switch to
sequential processing for nurture sequences (guiding qualified prospects through specific stages toward
conversion).
Signal Weight Assignment: Not All Signals Are Equal
Not all signals carry the same predictive power for conversion. A pricing page visit from a C-level
executive at a target account should carry substantially more weight than a blog post view from an intern
at a small company outside your ideal customer profile.
Your signal weights shouldn't be static. They should evolve based on ongoing performance data. If you
notice that prospects who trigger on competitor mentions convert at 40% higher rates than those who
trigger on content downloads, your scoring model should reflect this reality by increasing the weight
assigned to competitor mention signals.
This requires establishing a feedback loop between your scoring system and your conversion data.
Regularly review which signals correlate most strongly with closed deals and adjust accordingly.
Timing Correlation: Signal Velocity
One of the most underutilized aspects of signal intelligence is timing correlation. The temporal relationship
between signals often reveals more about buying intent than the signals themselves.
Understanding Signal Patterns
Consider two scenarios with identical signals but different timing:
Scenario A: A prospect visits your pricing page on Monday, downloads a case study on Tuesday, and
their company posts a relevant job opening on Wednesday.
Scenario B: A prospect visits your pricing page in January, downloads a case study in March, and their
company posts a job opening in May.
Both scenarios involve the same three signals, but they tell dramatically different stories about buying
intent. Scenario A shows concentrated, accelerating interest—likely indicating active evaluation. Scenario
B might simply reflect passive awareness spread over months.
In Clay, you can implement velocity tracking by creating date-stamped signal records and using formulas
to calculate the time elapsed between the first and most recent signal. When that timeframe is
compressed, urgency increases.
🎯
Scoring Systems: Point-Based vs. AI-Powered
Once you're capturing and orchestrating signals, you need a systematic way to convert that intelligence
into actionable prioritization. You have two primary approaches in Clay: point-based scoring models and
AI-powered scoring.
Marketing Newsletter | Marketing Resources | Marketing Services

James Praise | Marketing In Action
Point-Based Scoring
Point-based scoring works best when you have clean, structured data and clear conversion patterns. You
assign specific point values to different criteria and set thresholds that determine qualification status using
Clay's Native Score Row capability.
AI-Powered Scoring: Contextual and Adaptive
Sometimes you need AI-powered scoring instead of or in addition to point-based systems. AI scoring is
particularly valuable when:
● Your data is messy or inconsistent
● You're dealing with unstructured text that requires interpretation
● You need contextual understanding that goes beyond simple rules
● You don't yet know what weights to assign to different factors
AI Scoring Prompt Example:
Score this prospect from 1-100 considering: We sell best to high-growth tech
companies. Recent funding is a strong positive signal. Using our competitor
makes them harder to convert. Multiple signals indicate higher intent.
The key to effective AI scoring is being highly specific about your ideal customer profile and what signals
matter most for your particular business context. Generic prompts produce generic results. The more you
can teach the AI about your specific buying patterns, the more accurate your scores become.
Building Learning Scoring Systems
The most sophisticated scoring systems learn from past outcomes and continuously improve. This
requires establishing a closed feedback loop that tracks outcomes back to initial scores.
Start by tracking these key data points for every scored prospect:
● Initial score when they entered your system
● Which signals triggered their qualification
● Time from qualification to first sales conversation
● Conversion outcome (won, lost, or still in pipeline)
● Deal size if won
Over time, patterns will emerge. You might discover that prospects from certain industries convert at
dramatically higher rates even with lower scores, or that specific signal combinations are strong indicators
of conversion. Feed these insights back into your scoring model.

Signal stacking transforms isolated data points into strategic intelligence by combining multiple signals to
reveal genuine buying intent.
Weight signals based on actual conversion data and make those weights dynamic. Timing correlation can
reveal invaluable insights about buying intent.
Choose point-based scoring when you have clean data and clear patterns. Use AI-powered scoring for
messy data, unstructured text, or contextual understanding. The most sophisticated systems establish
feedback loops that track conversion data back to initial scores and continuously improve.
Companies that master signal orchestration generate better leads that convert at higher rates and close
faster, creating genuine competitive advantages in their go-to-market strategy.

ABM in Clay
What Makes ABM Different
Account-Based Marketing is fundamentally about precision over volume. Instead of casting a wide net
hoping to catch anything, ABM is like spear fishing. You identify which fish you want, study their behavior,
and strike with precision.
This means targeting 100 to 2,000 accounts maximum, with a few thousand total contacts per year.
Compare that to traditional prospecting where you might contact thousands of prospects daily. For
high-value accounts, generic messaging doesn't just fail—it actively damages relationships before they
even begin.
Clay as Your ABM Central Nervous System
Clay serves as the unified data layer that makes modern ABM possible. Think of it as the central nervous
system connecting your first-party data, enrichment providers, intent signals, and CRM. It's where all your
account intelligence comes together in one place.
Modern ABM requires accurate, real-time data at two levels:
At the company level, you need to understand how priorities are shifting. Is the company expanding? Did
they raise funding? Are they posting jobs that signal new initiatives? These signals tell you when accounts
are ready to engage.
At the people level, you need to identify the right person to reach at the right moment. Did someone new
join the buying committee? Did your champion move roles? Understanding personnel changes prevents
outreach from falling into a black hole.
The Unified ABM Motion
The ABM motion in Clay ties together demand generation, sales development, expansion, and customer
success. Instead of operating in silos, ABM creates a unified approach to penetrate your most valuable
prospects.
You start with real-time data monitoring—tracking job changes, company news, and intent signals. Then
you progress accounts through defined stages based on engagement. You orchestrate multi-channel
touchpoints including ads, events, personalized content, and direct outreach. Finally, you maintain
human-in-the-loop execution where ops teams continuously improve automation based on results.
The Three Core ABM Stages
Understanding how accounts move through your ABM funnel is critical. Each stage requires different
data, messaging, and tactics.
Marketing Newsletter | Marketing Resources | Marketing Services

James Praise | Marketing In Action
Stage 1: Aware
Accounts enter through LinkedIn connections, social engagement, website visits, event attendance, or
investor introductions. At this stage, they know you exist but haven't shown meaningful interest yet.
Your tactics include LinkedIn auto-connect sequences, paid advertising, personalized landing pages,
warm introductions, and event invitations. The goal is building awareness and establishing initial
relationships.
Stage 2: Interested
Accounts move here when they create a workspace, visit pricing pages, send positive replies, or attend
high-intent events. This is where curiosity transforms into genuine interest.
Tactics shift to retargeting ads, signal-based outbound sequences, webinars, and case studies. You're
now nurturing active interest and demonstrating value specific to their situation.
Stage 3: Evaluating
This stage is triggered by contact sales form submissions or discovery meetings. The account is actively
considering whether to buy, and every interaction matters.
Tactics become executive dinners, referrals, multi-threading across the organization, and pre-call
research briefs. You're removing friction and building conviction across multiple stakeholders.
Converting Accounts to Aware Stage
Systematic relationship building is key to getting accounts into your ABM motion.
● For events and dinners, filter your target list by location and contact grade, then auto-send invites
to relevant events. Geography-based targeting ensures you can meet prospects face-to-face
when they're ready.
● For warm introductions, upload your executives' LinkedIn connections, cross-reference with target
accounts, and identify mutual connections who can make introductions. Warm intros convert at
dramatically higher rates than cold outreach.
● LinkedIn auto-connect works well when triggered by engagement. Set up workflows that send
connection requests when prospects engage with content or visit landing pages—they're already
showing interest.
● Clay excels at social listening. Monitor relevant keywords and get alerts when prospects post
about topics related to your solution. This gives you perfect conversation starters grounded in
their actual priorities.
Moving Accounts to Interested Stage
Moving accounts from aware to interested requires deeper intelligence and personalization.
Marketing Newsletter | Marketing Resources | Marketing Services

● Use Claygent/Apify to scrape company websites, recent news, and SEC filings to identify their top
three business and technology priorities. Then create personalized landing pages that reference
these specific priorities. Generic messaging won't cut it at this stage.
● Track product signals if they're using your product (connect Snowflake or your data warehouse).
Monitor feature usage and trigger personalized help offers when they hit milestones. This
positions you as helpful rather than pushy.
● Web intent tracking becomes critical. Monitor not just page visits, but time on site and multiple
visits that indicate growing interest. Someone spending 8 minutes on your pricing page is telling
you something important.
Deploying High-Touch Tactics in Evaluating Stage
The evaluating stage is where you deploy your highest-touch tactics to close deals.
● Auto-generate pre-call research briefs that include company summaries, recent funding
information, potential partnership ideas, and relevant news. This arms your sales team with
conversation starters that demonstrate you've done your homework. First impressions matter
enormously at this stage.
● Multi-threading becomes essential. Use conversation intelligence tools like Gong to identify
stakeholders mentioned in calls, then reach both economic buyers and end users.
Single-threaded deals are fragile.
● Track new hires joining target accounts mid-evaluation. When key personas join during your sales
process, trigger immediate outreach to bring them up to speed. Don't let personnel changes derail
your momentum.
The Three-Table ABM Architecture
Here's how this works in practice with a three-table ABM workflow. This is the architecture we use at Clay
to manage our ABM motion, and you can replicate it for your accounts.
Table 1: Named Account List of Contacts
Import contacts from your CRM on a scheduled basis. Key columns include name, normalized LinkedIn
URL, current ABM stage, and contact grade. This serves as your source of truth for account progression
and ensures everyone is working from the same data.
Table 2: LinkedIn Brand Mentions Tracking
Use the LinkedIn Find Post Audiences action to pull mentions of your domain—at Clay we monitor
clay.com, but you can search for mentions of relevant keywords like your product category. Set this to run
daily within a defined timeframe.
Then classify posts with AI to determine if someone built something with your product, mentioned a
competitor, or showed buying intent. Enrich the poster's profile, normalize their LinkedIn URL, and check

if their company domain matches accounts in your CRM. Score the engagement level to prioritize
follow-up.
Table 3: Lookup and Stage Updates
Pull the current ABM stage from Table 1, lookup the LinkedIn URL from Table 2, and if you find a match
that meets your criteria, automatically update the stage and write changes back to your CRM.
This creates a closed-loop system where social signals automatically advance your ABM stages, ensuring
no engagement goes unnoticed. Your team gets real-time alerts about account activity, but they make the
strategic decisions about how to engage.
Key Takeaways
ABM in Clay is about precision over volume: targeting high-value accounts with coordinated,
multi-channel engagement rather than blasting thousands of prospects daily. Clay serves as your unified
data layer, connecting first-party data, enrichment providers, intent signals, and your CRM into a single
intelligence system.
At Clay, accounts progress through three stages: Aware (building initial relationships through LinkedIn,
events, and warm intros), Interested (nurturing active curiosity with personalized content and signal-based
outreach), and Evaluating (deploying high-touch tactics like executive dinners and multi-threading). Each
stage requires different data, messaging, and tactics.
What makes this engine work are five core principles: centralized ops ownership, continuous
improvement, multi-signal intelligence, proactive monitoring, and clear attribution. This approach scales
because humans focus on strategy and relationships while automation handles execution, creating a
system that gets smarter over time.

Advertising & Ad Intelligence in Clay
The Blind Spot in Traditional Advertising
Traditional advertising treats your audience like a faceless crowd. You spend thousands on LinkedIn ads,
Facebook campaigns, and Google search, but all you get back are numbers: 10,000 impressions, 200
clicks, 15 conversions. You know something happened, but you have no idea who made it happen. This
creates a massive blind spot where you can't follow up intelligently or build audiences that actually
convert.
Clay: From Advertising into Precision Targeting
Traditional Approach: You create a LinkedIn ad targeting VP of Marketing at SaaS companies. The ad
gets 1,000 impressions and 50 clicks. LinkedIn tells you the numbers, but you have no idea which specific
VPs clicked or what companies they work for. Maybe 3 people fill out your lead form, but the other 47 who
clicked remain anonymous. You've lost 94% of your engaged audience.
Clay-Powered Approach: You create the same LinkedIn ad. Clay's integration tracks the clicks and
identifies that Sarah Chen, VP of Marketing at Acme Corp, clicked your ad but didn't convert. Clay
automatically enriches Sarah's profile, adds her to a personalized sequence, and alerts your sales rep
that a high-intent prospect from a target account just engaged. Instead of losing 94% of your engaged
audience, you're following up with 100% of them.
The Three Stages of Clay-Powered Advertising
Stage 1: Building Better Audiences
Most teams build ad audiences in spreadsheets and upload them manually to LinkedIn or Facebook.
Match rates are usually low.
Clay lets you build specific audiences using a combination of enrichment data, intent signals, engagement
scoring, and CRM data. This precision dramatically improves match rates and campaign performance.
Stage 2: Tracking Engagement
Clay's LinkedIn integration tracks engagement demographics in real-time, identifying the person taking
each action and setting the stage for in-depth enrichment and qualification.
Instead of seeing anonymous engagement data, you see exactly which prospects from which target
accounts are engaging with your ads. This transforms advertising from a numbers game into
relationship-building intelligence.
Stage 3: Automated Follow-Up
When someone engages with your ad but doesn't convert, you can automatically add them to
personalized sequences, alerts your sales team, or triggers account-based campaigns.
Marketing Newsletter | Marketing Resources | Marketing Services

Your advertising spend generates qualified pipeline, not just awareness metrics. Every engagement
becomes an opportunity for intelligent follow-up rather than a lost opportunity.
Competitive Ad Intelligence
Clay integrates with ad intelligence tools like Adyntel to show you exactly what your competitors are
doing. Input any company domain and see up to 10 of their active LinkedIn ads, complete with creative
formats, ad copy, headlines, and CTAs.
For Google ads, you can filter by media type and see their text, image, and video campaigns with start
and end dates. This gives you instant visibility into competitor messaging, positioning, and campaign
strategies.
You can combine this competitive intelligence with spend analysis to identify which companies are
actively investing in advertising and experiencing growth—signals that often indicate market momentum
or new initiatives.
Identifying High-Intent Advertisers
Here's a workflow marketing teams use to identify companies showing strong buying signals through their
advertising behavior:
1. Pull advertising spend data from Adbeat to see each company's media mix, total spend, and top
ad networks. This reveals budget allocation and commitment to paid channels.
2. Pull traffic source breakdown from Semrush to see monthly visits, organic social visits, paid
search visits, and paid social visits.
3. Calculate paid traffic percentage using an AI Formula: paid search plus paid social divided by
total visits times 100. High percentages indicate companies relying heavily on paid acquisition.
4. Add traffic growth signals from Aviato to see 30-day, 3-month, and yearly traffic changes. Growth
combined with high ad spend suggests companies scaling aggressively.
Companies that score high on paid traffic percentage, total ad spend, and traffic growth get flagged as
high-intent advertisers—they're investing heavily and growing, making them prime prospects.
End-to-End Campaign Example
Here's how this works in practice. Let's say you're selling marketing automation software and want to run
an ABM campaign targeting growing SaaS companies.
Step 1: Identify Engaged Prospects from Social Interactions
Use Clay's social listening to track people who are reacting to, commenting on, or engaging with relevant
content—your posts, competitor posts, or industry thought leaders.
Step 2: Enrich Contact Data and Validate Fit
Marketing Newsletter | Marketing Resources | Marketing Services

James Praise | Marketing In Action
For each person engaging with your content, enrich their profile to confirm they're decision-makers at
your target accounts. Filter out anyone outside your ICP before spending ad dollars.
Step 3: Enrich for Ad Matching
If you're uploading to Facebook or Google Ads, use Versium to get email hashes. Use conditional
formulas to filter out non-ICP contacts and ensure clean data for maximum match rates.
Step 4: Push to Ad Platforms
In Clay, you can natively create a custom LinkedIn audience by clicking Create ad audience in
Exports and connecting your LinkedIn Ad Account. Choose Contact List then map the fields accordingly.
Processing takes around 48 hours and Clay shows the match rate after the sync completes, or the
percentage of uploaded company or contact information successfully matched to a LinkedIn member
account.
Step 5: Track Engagement
See which specific people from which target accounts are clicking, viewing, and engaging with your ads.
Step 6: Trigger Automated Follow-Up
Add engaged prospects to personalized email sequences, alert sales reps about high-intent accounts,
and create retargeting audiences based on their behavior.
Retargeting with Precision
This approach works powerfully for retargeting campaigns. When someone visits your website, Clay can
identify them, enrich their data, add them to a retargeting audience, and push that audience to LinkedIn or
Facebook. You can serve personalized ads based on which pages they visited and track exactly who
converts.
Key Takeaways
Traditional advertising treats your audience like anonymous traffic. Clay identifies exactly who engages
with your ads and automatically triggers personalized follow-up, turning every engagement into a
relationship-building opportunity.
Clay integrates with ad intelligence tools and with spend analysis tools to identify high-intent advertisers.
Companies with high paid traffic percentages, total ad spend, and traffic growth become prime targets.
An end-to-end workflow starts with social listening to identify engaged prospects, enriches and validates
fit, prepares data for ad platforms, pushes to LinkedIn with native integrations, tracks real-time
engagement, and triggers automated follow-up. This transforms advertising from awareness metrics into
qualified pipeline with full attribution.
