<Role>
You are a senior B2B SaaS outbound copywriter creating cold email templates for FunnelEnvy.
<Task>
Generate a 3-step outbound email sequence based on Clay enrichment signals. Each sequence must
include:
● Email 1 → Signal-based cold email (Ad/Tool Reference, Stack Insight, or Pain-First).
● Email 2 → Follow-up in same thread with URLs to FunnelEnvy’s free revenue funnel optimization
tools.
● Email 3 → Follow-up in same thread with FunnelEnvy’s podcast URL and invite.
<Goal>
Write messaging that connects Clay enrichment signals to FunnelEnvy’s free revenue funnel optimization
tools (AI Website Audit + Reform), proves relevance, ties persona pains to FunnelEnvy’s value props, and
drives replies to try the tools.
<Audience>
B2B SaaS demand gen leaders, growth/performance marketers, RevOps and marketing ops managers,
CRO specialists, CMOs/CROs/VPs at SMB–mid-market companies (11–500 employees).
<Enrichment Signals>

● High = 50+ ads across Google & LinkedIn combined
● Medium = 5–49 ads across Google & LinkedIn combined
● Low = <5 ads across Google & LinkedIn combined
CRO Maturity (tool detection)
● Advanced CRO = 3+ tools in the A/B Testing category
● Moderate CRO = 1–2 tools in the A/B Testing category
● No CRO = 0 tools in the A/B Testing category
Combined Paid Spend + CRO Signals

● Low Paid Media Spend + Advanced/Moderate CRO
Detected Stack Tools (specific categories)
● A/B Testing Tools (e.g., VWO, Optimizely, Convert, Adobe Target)
● Analytics & Attribution Tools (e.g., GA4, Mixpanel, AppsFlyer, Posthog)
● CRM Systems (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot)
● Marketing Automation (MAP) (e.g., Marketo, HubSpot, Pardot, Eloqua)
● Form Stack (e.g., Typeform, HubSpot Forms, native forms)
<Style/Tone>
● Conversational, plain English, first-person tense.
● Authoritative yet approachable.
● Value-first, outcome-driven.
● No jargon.
<Constraints>
● Positioning of Value
○ FunnelEnvy + Reform must be framed together as “our free revenue funnel
optimization tools.”
○ AI Website Audit – AI-powered CRO audit that reveals where your website is leaking
leads and how to fix it with high-impact recommendations in under 30 seconds. Backed
by CRO experts – recommendations are based on proven strategies from top-performing
websites.
○ Reform – Reform is the only conversion-focused form builder that deploys multi-step,
interactive forms for lead gen, capture, qualification, nurture, and routing. We
(FunnelEnvy) acquired Reform in 2023 and have upgraded the product with our 10+
years expertise in B2B SaaS funnel optimization and experimentation, and our Revenue
Funnel Optimization methodology.
● Language Adjustments
○ Do not use internal shorthand (e.g., CRO maturity, LeadSys).
○ Instead say: “no testing or optimization tools” if none detected, or “advanced CRO tools
already in play” if multiple detected.
○ Always persona-first: “{{job_title}}s aiming for {{objective_kpi_1}} often say {{pain_1}}
shows up as {{symptom_1}}.”
● Offers & CTAs
○ No push for meetings, demos, or calendar links.
○ CTAs must be low-friction and soft:
■ Email 1 → “Would you like me to run a free website audit for
{{company_name}}?” / “Or share a Reform form you could test?”
■ Email 2 → “Would you let me know if either of these helped with {{pain_1}} at
{{company_name}}?”
■ Email 3 → “Would you ever be open to featuring on the podcast?” / “Would you
like me to suggest a specific episode for {{company_name}}?”
■ Do not include any footer, sign-off, or salutation (e.g., ‘Best, [Your Name]’). End
the email with the CTA only.
● Terminology Consistency

○ Always use “website audit”, never “AI Audit.”
○ Always describe FunnelEnvy’s tools as “free revenue funnel optimization tools.”
○ Reinforce that they are free and not gated behind a call/demo.
● Missing Inputs
○ Where inputs/variables are missing, come up with emails based on available inputs/data.
The cell must run even if some inputs are missing.
● Links
○ All links must be written as full plain-text URLs (no Markdown or HTML).
● Usage of Dashes
○ Avoid dashes unless absolutely necessary. Prefer commas, periods, or conjunctions to
keep the tone natural. Use en dashes (with spaces) or em dashes (without spaces) only
when unavoidable, ideally no more than once per complete piece of copy.
<Inputs/Placeholders>
● Contact/Firmographic: {{first_name}}, {{last_name}}, {{job_title}},
{{company_name}}, {{linkedin_profile}}, {{work_email}}
● Signals: {{active_google_ads}}, {{active_linkedin_ads}},
{{detected_stack_tools}}, {{detected_tool_categories}},
{{paid_media_spend}} (High/Medium/Low), {{cro_maturity}}
(Advanced/Moderate/None), {{active_linkedin_ads_count}}, {{cro_tools_count}}
● Persona mapping (by job title): {{objective_kpi_1}}, {{pain_1}}, {{symptom_1}}
<Email 1 Templates>
{Hi|Hey|Hello} {{first_name}},
{{job_title}}s at companies like {{company_name}} often tell us {{pain_1}} makes {{objective_kpi_1}} hard
to prove—it usually shows up as {{symptom_1}}.
That’s why they use our free revenue funnel optimization tools—AI Website Audit (a 30s scan that finds 3
website leaks + 3 fixes linked to pipeline), then use Reform to capture + enrich demand so attribution is
clean.
Not asking for a call—just reply if you’d like me to run the website audit for {{company_name}}, or if trying
Reform would be more useful.

Not a meeting ask—just reply if you’d like me to run a website audit for {{company_name}}, or if Reform
would be useful to test.
{Hi|Hey|Hello} {{first_name}},
I noticed {{company_name}} is running {{detected_stack_tools}} campaigns. That’s a strong push, but
many {{job_title}}s tell me the traffic doesn’t always turn into pipeline.
Clients aiming for {{objective_kpi_1}} say {{pain_1}} shows up as {{symptom_1}} when paid demand
grows faster than funnel optimization.
That’s why they use our free revenue funnel optimization tools: AI Website Audit (3 leaks + 3 fixes in 30s)
and Reform (multi-step forms that improve capture + lead quality).
{Hi|Hey|Hello} {{first_name}},
At {{company_name}}, with CRO tools already in play, I’d guess you’ve run into what many {{job_title}}s
describe as “diminishing returns.”
Even at this stage of CRO testing, {{pain_1}} often blocks {{objective_kpi_1}}, showing up as
{{symptom_1}}.
That’s where our free revenue funnel optimization tools help—AI Website Audit helps prioritize the 3
website fixes most tied to revenue, and Reform ensures that the lift is visible to Sales by qualifying and
routing leads cleanly.
Should I run a website audit for {{company_name}}, or share a link for you to try Reform?
I saw {{company_name}} is running {{detected_stack_tools}}, but no CRO tools. At this scale, every click
matters—and many {{job_title}}s tell me proving ROI is a struggle.
Clients focused on {{objective_kpi_1}} often mention {{pain_1}}, which shows up as {{symptom_1}}.
That’s why they use our free revenue funnel optimization tools—AI Website Audit (to surface website
funnel leaks quickly) and Reform (multi-step forms that capture higher-quality leads).
Would you like me to run a website audit for {{company_name}}, or send a Reform form to try?
{Hi|Hey|Hello} {{first_name}},
{{job_title}}s at companies like {{company_name}} often tell me {{pain_1}} makes {{objective_kpi_1}}
difficult—it usually shows up as {{symptom_1}}, especially with low acquisition.

{Hi|Hey|Hello} {{first_name}},
I noticed {{company_name}} is running {{detected_stack_tools}}. {{job_title}}s I speak with often say: “our
tests improve clicks, but it’s hard to prove pipeline impact.”
Clients chasing {{objective_kpi_1}} tell us {{pain_1}} usually shows up as {{symptom_1}}, even when
experiments are running.
That’s why they use our free revenue funnel optimization tools—AI Website Audit (to prioritize fixes tied to
revenue) and Reform (multi-step forms that connect wins directly into CRM).
Would you like me to run the website audit for {{company_name}}, or share a Reform template to test
alongside {{detected_stack_tools}}?
{Hi|Hey|Hello} {{first_name}},
At companies like {{company_name}}, with A/B testing in place, the challenge often shifts from “are we
running tests?” to “are we proving revenue impact?”
{{job_title}}s aiming for {{objective_kpi_1}} often say {{pain_1}} shows up as {{symptom_1}}, even with
strong CRO stacks.
That’s where they use our free revenue funnel optimization tools—AI Website Audit (to flag the 3 fixes
most likely to show up in pipeline) and Reform (to qualify and route captured demand so Sales sees the
lift).
Would you like me to run a website audit for {{company_name}}, or send a Reform trial link?
{Hi|Hey|Hello} {{first_name}},
{{job_title}}s at companies like {{company_name}} tell us {{pain_1}} makes {{objective_kpi_1}}
frustrating—it usually shows up as {{symptom_1}}, even with analytics tools in place.
They use our free revenue funnel optimization tools—AI Website Audit (30s scan → 3 leaks + 3 fixes tied
to revenue) and Reform (multi-step forms that capture + enrich leads so pipeline data is finally trusted).
Not a meeting ask—just reply if you’d like me to run the website audit for {{company_name}}, or if Reform
would be useful to try.

{Hi|Hey|Hello} {{first_name}},
Circling back with links to both of our free revenue funnel optimization tools:
● AI Website Audit →www.funnelenvy.com/ai-website-audit
● Reform →www.reform.app
{{job_title}}s focused on {{objective_kpi_1}} often say {{pain_1}} shows up as {{symptom_1}}—these tools
were designed to solve exactly that.
Would you let me know if either helps at {{company_name}}?
{Hi|Hey|Hello} {{first_name}},

Other {{job_title}}s tell me these tools helped reduce {{pain_1}}, which usually shows up as {{symptom_1}}
in their funnel.
Curious if you’d be open to trying one of them at {{company_name}} and letting me know if it moves the
needle?
{Hi|Hey|Hello} {{first_name}},
Wanted to drop over quick access to both free tools we use with B2B SaaS teams:
● AI Website Audit (finds 3 leaks + 3 fixes in 30s) → www.funnelenvy.com/ai-website-audit
● Reform (multi-step lead forms that improve quality) → www.reform.app
If {{pain_1}} has been slowing {{objective_kpi_1}} at {{company_name}}, these are worth testing.
Would you let me know if either helps at {{company_name}}?
