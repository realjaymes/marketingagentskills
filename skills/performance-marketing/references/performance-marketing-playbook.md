# Performance Marketing Playbook

## Overview

This playbook provides a complete framework for planning, executing, and optimizing paid advertising campaigns across all major platforms. It covers universal principles, creative strategy, platform-specific tactics, tracking, and operational execution.

---

## Section 1: Universal Principles of High-Performing Ads

Everything else in this playbook only works if these principles are understood and applied correctly. Paid advertising is not primarily about creativity. It is about attention, relevance, timing, and belief transfer.

### What an Ad Is (and What It Is Not)

An ad is not a salesperson. An ad is a filter.

**Its job is to:**
- Interrupt attention
- Qualify the right audience
- Move the right person one step forward

**Its job is NOT to:**
- Explain everything
- Convince skeptics
- Close complex purchases

Most ads fail because they attempt to compress the entire buyer journey into a single impression.

### The Attention Reality

Every platform is an attention marketplace. You are competing with friends, entertainment, news, work messages, and habit.

**This means:**
- Attention is borrowed, not given
- You must earn it immediately
- You do not get warm-up time

If your ad does not create a reason to stop within the first 1-2 seconds on feed-based platforms or the first headline on search, it will not be seen.

### Interruption vs Invitation

**Interruption Ads** stop the scroll by force:
- Bold claims
- Pattern breaks
- Strong opinions
- Visual disruption

Best for: Cold audiences, feed-based platforms, awareness and consideration

**Invitation Ads** invite attention because intent already exists:
- Keyword-matched copy
- Problem-aware messaging
- Clear relevance signals

Best for: Search, retargeting, high-intent users

### Audience Awareness Levels

Every ad should be written for one awareness level, not all of them.

| Level | What They Know | Creative Approach |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| Unaware | Don't know they have a problem | Stories, patterns, lifestyle, education |
| Problem-Aware | Feel the pain but don't know the solution | Pain articulation and reframing |
| Solution-Aware | Know solutions exist but not which one | Differentiation and category framing |
| Product-Aware | Know you but are undecided | Proof, objections, reassurance |
| Most-Aware | Ready to act | Urgency, offer clarity, friction removal |

### The Universal Ad Anatomy

Every high-performing ad contains the same core components:

1. **Hook** - Earns attention. Audience-first, not brand-first. One idea only. Specific beats clever.

2. **Context and Relatability** - Where belief begins. Describe the situation, not the solution. Use the audience's language.

3. **Value Proposition** - Answers "Why should I care?" One promise per ad. Outcome over features.

4. **Proof and Credibility** - Reduces risk. Numbers, screenshots, testimonials, authority.

5. **Offer** - Answers "What happens if I click?" Match offer to intent level.

6. **CTA** - Directs action. One action only. Low commitment beats aggressive selling for cold traffic.

### Cost of Inaction

One of the most underused levers in paid ads. Instead of only asking "What do I get if I act?" also answer "What does it cost if I don't?" This reframes urgency without discounts or pressure.

### The Golden Rule

If an ad is not working, assume the problem is clarity before creativity. Fix the message before fixing the design.

---

## Section 2: Creative Strategy Guide

Creative strategy answers three questions:
- What does the audience already believe?
- What must change in their mind next?
- What format best causes that shift on this platform?

### Funnel Stage Framework

| Stage | Goal | Audience State | Creative Must Do | Avoid |
|-------|------|----------------|------------------|-------|
| TOFU (Cold) | Create recognition and curiosity | Busy, distracted, skeptical, not shopping | Interrupt attention, name the problem, reframe | Selling, feature lists |
| MOFU (Warm) | Build belief and preference | Curious, comparing options, evaluating credibility | Demonstrate value, reduce uncertainty, differentiate | Over-educating without proof |
| BOFU (Hot) | Remove friction, prompt action | Interested, risk-aware, close to deciding | Address objections, reinforce proof, make action feel safe | Introducing new concepts |

---

## Section 4: Platform-Specific Playbooks

### Google Ads (Search)

**Mindset:** Demand capture, not demand creation. Relevance and clarity over persuasion.

**Buyer Intent:** Problem-aware or solution-aware, actively comparing options

**When It Works Best:**
- Clear, high-intent queries exist
- Problem can be expressed in words
- Commercial intent behind keywords

**When It Fails:**
- Category is new or undefined
- Users don't know what to search
- Product requires heavy education

**Ad Structure (Responsive Search Ads):**
- 1 ad group = 1 intent theme
- 4-6 keywords max per ad group
- 15 headlines, 4 descriptions
- Headline 1: Keyword mirror
- Headline 2: Primary benefit
- Headline 3: CTA or qualifier

**What Works:** Exact and phrase match, clear qualifiers, strong landing page alignment

**Specs:** Headlines 30 chars, Descriptions 90 chars

---

---

## Section 5: Tracking & Attribution

### Core Tracking Components

| Layer | Purpose | Examples |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Pixel / Base Tag | Page-level behavior tracking | Meta Pixel, Google Tag, LinkedIn Insight Tag |
| Event Tracking | Key actions and intent signals | View content, add to cart, lead, purchase |
| Conversion API (CAPI) | Server-side reliability | Meta CAPI, Google Enhanced Conversions |
| Mobile Attribution (MMP) | Install attribution, fraud control | Appsflyer, Adjust |
| Analytics Layer | Cross-channel truth | GA4, Amplitude, Mixpanel |

### Event Design

Track meaningful intent, not everything.

| Funnel Stage | Events |
|--------------|--------|
| TOFU | View content, scroll depth |
| MOFU | Product views, pricing views |
| BOFU | Lead, demo, purchase |

Assign conversion values, even if estimated. Platforms optimize better with value signals.

### Attribution Models

| Model | Best Use | Risk |
|-------|----------|------|
| Last Click | High-intent capture | Undervalues discovery |
| First Click | Awareness evaluation | Overcredits early touch |
| Data-Driven | Mature accounts | Needs volume |
| Platform-Reported | Optimization feedback | Over-credits itself |

**Operating rule:**
- Use platform attribution to optimize delivery
- Use analytics attribution to decide spend
- Use MMP attribution to decide app spend

### Validation Checklist

Before scaling:
- Pixel installed on all pages
- Events firing correctly
- CAPI active and deduplicated
- Conversions appearing in ad platforms
- Analytics numbers directionally aligned
- MMP SDK installed correctly (mobile)
- Events deduplicated between MMP and platform

Never scale on broken tracking.

---

## Section 6: Operational Execution

### Testing Priority Stack

Test in this order:
1. **Message** - Hook, pain articulation, value proposition
2. **Creative format** - Video vs static, demo vs POV vs testimonial
3. **Audience** - Cold vs warm, broad vs narrow
4. **Bidding** - Only after creative and message are validated

Change one variable at a time. Never change creative and targeting in the same test cycle.

### Kill Rules

Kill an ad if:
- CTR is 40-60% below account average after learning
- CPC is rising while CTR is falling
- Engagement drops but frequency rises

Time-based:
- Cold ads: review after 3-5 days
- Retargeting ads: review after 48-72 hours

### Scale Rules

Scale only when:
- CTR is stable or improving
- CPA is within target range
- Conversion rate is consistent

Safe scaling:
- Increase budget by 20-30% every 48 hours
- Duplicate winning ads into new audiences
- Expand placement, not message

Avoid:
- Doubling budgets overnight
- Editing winning creatives

### Creative Refresh Cadence

| Funnel Stage | Refresh |
|--------------|---------|
| TOFU | Every 2-4 weeks |
| MOFU | Every 1-2 weeks |
| BOFU | Weekly or bi-weekly |

### Signal Interpretation

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| High CTR, low conversions | Landing page mismatch | Fix LP, not ads |
| Low CTR, high CVR | Weak hook | Rewrite hook |
| Rising CPA, stable CTR | Auction pressure | Improve differentiation |
| Flat performance | Creative fatigue | Refresh angle |

---

## Section 7: Scalable Growth

### Budget Allocation by Funnel Stage

**Early Stage:**
- BOFU (Search, Retargeting): 40-50%
- MOFU (Demos, Education): 30-35%
- TOFU (Awareness): 15-25%

**Growth Stage:** TOFU grows to feed MOFU as data stabilizes.

### Cross-Platform Sequencing

Platforms are sequential, not parallel:

1. **Meta / TikTok** - Create awareness and demand signals
2. **YouTube / LinkedIn** - Educate and build trust
3. **Google Search** - Capture demand
4. **Retargeting everywhere** - Reinforce belief and remove friction

### Learning Transfer

**What transfers well:**
- Hooks
- Pain language
- Objections
- Proof formats

**What does not transfer:**
- Visual styles
- Length
- Tone

A winning Meta hook becomes a Google headline, LinkedIn opening line, and YouTube opening statement.

### Avoiding Platform Silos

- One shared creative library
- Weekly cross-platform review
- One owner per message, not per platform

Platforms execute differently. Strategy stays centralized.
