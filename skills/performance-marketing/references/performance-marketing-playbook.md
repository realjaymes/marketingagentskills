Section 1: Universal Principles of High-Performing Ads

This section is the foundation of the entire playbook. Everything else –
creative formats, platform tactics, specs – only works if these
principles are understood and applied correctly.

Paid advertising is not primarily about creativity. It is about
attention, relevance, timing, and belief transfer. Creative is the
vehicle, not the strategy.

What an Ad Is (and What It Is Not)

An ad is **not** a salesperson. An ad is a filter.

Its job is to:

> ● Interrupt attention
>
> ● Qualify the right audience
>
> ● Move the right person one step forward

Its job is **not** to:

> ● Explain everything ● Convince skeptics
>
> ● Close complex purchases

Most ads fail because they attempt to compress the entire buyer journey
into a single impression. High-performing ads respect cognitive limits
and funnel logic.

The Attention Reality

Every platform is an attention marketplace. You are not competing only
with other advertisers. You are competing with:

> ● Friends
>
> ● Entertainment ● News
>
> ● Work messages
>
> ● Anxiety, boredom, and habit

This means:

> <img src="./g0obidmt.png"
> style="width:0.85417in;height:0.32292in" />[<u>🔐 Get full yearly
> access here →</u>](https://selar.com/marketingresources)

󰗑 This is part of [**<u>MIA Marketing
Resources</u>**](https://marketinginaction.xyz/resources/)

> ● Attention is borrowed, not given ● You must earn it immediately
>
> ● You do not get “warm-up time”

Practical Implication

If your ad does not create a reason to stop within the first:

> ● 1–2 seconds on feed-based platforms ● First headline on search

It will not be seen, regardless of how good the offer is.

Interruption vs Invitation

High-performing ads fall into two categories:

Interruption Ads

These stop the scroll by force.

> ● Bold claims
>
> ● Pattern breaks ● Strong opinions ● Visual disruption

They work best for:

> ● Cold audiences
>
> ● Feed-based platforms
>
> ● Awareness and consideration

Invitation Ads

These invite attention because intent already exists.

> ● Keyword-matched copy
>
> ● Problem-aware messaging ● Clear relevance signals

They work best for:

> ● Search
>
> ● Retargeting

󰗑 This is part of [**<u>MIA Marketing
Resources</u>**](https://marketinginaction.xyz/resources/)

> ● High-intent users

Mistake to avoid: using invitation-style ads in interruption
environments and vice versa.

Audience Awareness Levels

Every ad should be written for **one** **awareness** **level**, not all
of them.

Unaware

They do not know they have a problem.

> ● Use stories, patterns, lifestyle, education

Problem-Aware

They feel the pain but do not know the solution.

> ● Use pain articulation and reframing

Solution-Aware

They know solutions exist but not which one.

> ● Use differentiation and category framing

Product-Aware

They know you but are undecided.

> ● Use proof, objections, reassurance

Most-Aware

They are ready to act.

> ● Use urgency, offer clarity, friction removal

Mistake to avoid: writing product-aware ads for problem-unaware
audiences.

The Universal Ad Anatomy

Every high-performing ad contains the same core components. The
weighting changes by platform, but the structure does not.

1\. Hook

The hook earns attention.

Rules:

> ● Audience-first, not brand-first ● One idea only
>
> ● Specific beats clever

Effective hook types:

> ● Call out a painful truth
>
> ● Contradict common advice ● Show a surprising outcome ● Start
> mid-situation

2\. Context and Relatability

This is where belief begins.

Rules:

> ● Describe the situation, not the solution ● Use the audience’s
> language
>
> ● Signal “this is for you” clearly

3\. Value Proposition

This answers: “Why should I care?”

Rules:

> ● One promise per ad
>
> ● Outcome over features ● Tie benefit to pain

4\. Proof and Credibility

This reduces risk.

> style="width:0.85417in;height:0.32292in" />[<u>🔐 Get full yearly
> access here →</u>](https://selar.com/marketingresources)

󰗑 This is part of [**<u>MIA Marketing
Resources</u>**](https://marketinginaction.xyz/resources/)

Forms of proof:

> ● Numbers and benchmarks ● Screenshots and demos
>
> ● Testimonials and logos ● Authority and expertise

5\. Offer

This answers: “What happens if I click?”

Rules:

> ● Match offer to intent level ● Reduce perceived effort ● Increase
> perceived value

6\. CTA

This directs action.

Rules:

> ● One action only
>
> ● Language should match mindset
>
> ● Low commitment beats aggressive selling for cold traffic

Functional, Emotional, and Financial Benefits

Strong ads communicate value on three levels.

**Functional**

What does this do better?

**Emotional**

How does this make me feel?

**Financial**

What does this save or earn?

High-performing ads usually lead with **one** and reinforce with the
others.

󰗑 This is part of [**<u>MIA Marketing
Resources</u>**](https://marketinginaction.xyz/resources/)

Cost of Inaction

One of the most underused levers in paid ads.

Instead of only asking: “What do I get if I act?”

Also answer: “What does it cost if I don’t?”

This reframes urgency without discounts or pressure.

Differentiation and Category Framing

Most ads fail because they sound interchangeable.

Differentiation does not mean:

> ● Feature lists ● Buzzwords
>
> ● Generic claims

It means:

> ● Framing the problem differently ● Naming a tradeoff others ignore ●
> Owning a point of view

Often, **how** **you** **explain** **the** **problem** is more
differentiating than the solution itself.

Why Good Ads Still Fail

Common reasons:

> ● Wrong audience awareness level ● Weak or unclear offer
>
> ● Landing page mismatch
>
> ● Platform-native rules ignored ● Insufficient budget for learning

Ads amplify clarity. They do not create it.

The Golden Rule of Paid Advertising

If an ad is not working, assume the problem is **clarity** **before**
**creativity**.

Fix the message before fixing the design.

Section 1 Summary – Universal Principles of High-Performing Ads

> **Principle**
>
> Ads are filters, not closers
>
> Attention is borrowed
>
> Interruption vs invitation
>
> Awareness levels matter
>
> One core promise per ad
>
> Proof reduces risk
>
> CTA must match mindset
>
> Functional, emotional, financial value

**What** **It** **Means** **in** **Practice**

The ad moves the right person one step forward

You must earn attention instantly

Match creative to intent level

One ad = one awareness level

Outcome beats features

Belief comes from evidence

Low friction wins cold traffic

Strong ads signal value on multiple levels

**Common** **Failure** **Mode**

Trying to explain everything in one ad

Slow intros, branding first

Using soft copy in feeds or hype in search

Mixing education, proof, and CTA together

Feature dumping

Claims without validation

“Book a demo” too early

Only talking features or price

**Correction**

Narrow the message to one belief shift

Lead with audience pain or disruption

Align tone to platform behavior

Segment ads by awareness stage

Choose the single strongest outcome

Add numbers, screenshots, voices

Step down the commitment

Lead with one, reinforce others

Delay has consequences

How you explain the problem matters

Ads don’t fix weak positioning

Relying on fake urgency

Sounding interchangeable

Tweaking creatives endlessly

Show real tradeoffs

Own a POV

Fix message before design

Section 2: Creative Strategy Guide (What to Run, When, and Why)

This section is not a list of ad ideas. It is a **decision** **system**
for choosing the right creative based on intent, awareness, and platform
behavior.

Creative strategy answers three questions:

> ● What does the audience already believe? ● What must change in their
> mind next?
>
> ● What format best causes that shift on this platform? ● What format
> best causes that shift on this platform?

Creative Selection Starts With Funnel Stage

Do not start with formats. Start with intent.

Top of Funnel (Cold)

Goal: Create recognition and curiosity.

What the audience feels:

> ● Busy
>
> ● Distracted ● Skeptical
>
> ● Not actively shopping

What creative must do:

> ● Interrupt attention ● Name the problem
>
> ● Reframe the situation

Middle of Funnel (Warm)

Goal: Build belief and preference.

What the audience feels:

> ● Curious
>
> ● Comparing options

󰗑 This is part of [**<u>MIA Marketing
Resources</u>**](https://marketinginaction.xyz/resources/)

> ● Evaluating credibility

What creative must do:

> ● Demonstrate value ● Reduce uncertainty ● Differentiate clearly

Bottom of Funnel (Hot)

Goal: Remove friction and prompt action.

What the audience feels:

> ● Interested ● Risk-aware
>
> ● Close to deciding

What creative must do:

> ● Address objections ● Reinforce proof
>
> ● Make action feel safe

Mistake to avoid: running bottom-of-funnel creatives to cold audiences
and calling the platform “too expensive.”

1\. Pain Point Ads

When to Use

Creative Rotation and Fatigue Rules

Creative does not fail suddenly. It decays.

Signals of fatigue:

> ● Rising CPM ● Falling CTR
>
> ● Stable conversion rate

Rules of thumb:

> ● Cold creative: refresh every 2–4 weeks ● Retargeting creative:
> rotate weekly
>
> ● Never change creative and targeting at the same time

Matching Creative to Platform Reality

Do not reuse creative blindly.

> ● Meta rewards native-looking content ● LinkedIn rewards clarity and
> credibility
>
> ● TikTok rewards authenticity and speed
>
> ● Google Search rewards relevance, not persuasion ● Reddit rewards
> respect for context

Creative strategy is translation, not duplication.

Section 4: Platform-Specific Playbooks

This section translates the previous sections into **execution**
**reality**. Each platform behaves differently because user intent,
attention mode, and native norms differ. Treating platforms as
interchangeable is one of the fastest ways to burn budget.

The structure for each platform is consistent:

> ● Platform mindset ● Buyer intent reality
>
> ● Campaign types and what they actually do ● Creative strategy by
> funnel stage
>
> ● Specs and constraints (what you must obey) ● What typically works vs
> what usually fails

1\. Google Ads (Search)

Platform Mindset

Google Search is **demand** **capture**, not demand creation. Users
arrive with intent already formed. Your job is relevance and clarity,
not persuasion.

If Meta and TikTok reward interruption, Google rewards alignment.

Buyer Intent Reality

> ● Users are problem-aware or solution-aware ● They are actively
> comparing options
>
> ● Emotional hooks matter less than precision

When Google Search Works Best

> ● Clear, high-intent queries exist
>
> ● The problem can be expressed in words
>
> ● There is commercial intent behind the keyword

When Google Search Performs Poorly

> ● Category is new or undefined
>
> ● Users don’t know what to search yet
>
> ● Product requires heavy education upfront

Campaign Types (What They Actually Do)

> **Campaign** **Type**
>
> Search
>
> Performance Max

**What** **It’s** **For**

High-intent lead or sales capture

Incremental reach + retargeting support

**What** **It’s** **Not** **For**

Awareness or storytelling

Primary learning channel

Creative Strategy by Funnel Stage (Google Search)

> **Funnel** **Stage**
>
> MOFU / BOFU
>
> BOFU

**Creative** **Focus**

Problem–solution clarity

Objection handling

**What** **Matters** **Most**

Keyword-to-headline match

Proof, pricing signals, trust

Key rule: **If** **headline** **1** **does** **not** **mirror**
**search** **intent,** **you** **lose** **the** **auction** **before**
**bidding** **matters.**

Ad Structure (Responsive Search Ads)

Mandatory best practice:

> ● 1 ad group = 1 intent theme
>
> ● 4–6 keywords max per ad group ● 15 headlines, 4 descriptions

Headline roles:

> ● Headline 1: Keyword mirror
>
> ● Headline 2: Primary benefit or differentiator ● Headline 3: CTA or
> qualifier

Description roles:

> ● One outcome-driven ● One proof-driven
>
> ● One reassurance-driven

>
> ● Objection-aware copy

What Fails on Google Search

>
> ● Broad match without negatives ● Mismatched landing pages

Specs and Constraints (Search)

>
> Headlines per ad
>
> Descriptions per ad

**Limit**

30 characters

Bidding Reality

Recommended progression:

> 1\. Maximize Clicks (data collection) 2. Maximize Conversions
> (learning)
>
> 3\. Target CPA or Target ROAS (scaling)

Do not jump to automated bidding without sufficient conversion data.

2\. Meta Ads (Facebook & Instagram)

Platform Mindset

Meta is an **attention** **and** **behavior** **engine**. People are not
shopping. You must earn attention emotionally before logic can enter.

Native, human, imperfect content consistently outperforms polished brand
ads.

Buyer Intent Reality

> ● Mostly unaware or problem-aware ● Low patience, fast scrolling
>
> ● Emotional resonance beats logic

Campaign Types (What They Actually Do)

> **Objective**
>
> Awareness
>
> Traffic
>
> Leads
>
> Sales

**Real** **Use** **Case**

Cheap reach, early signal collection

Content distribution, warm-up

Lead magnets, forms, demos

Retargeting and proven offers

Creative Strategy by Funnel Stage (Meta)

> **Funnel** **Stage**
>
> TOFU
>
> MOFU
>
> BOFU

**Creative** **Types** **That** **Work**

Pain point, lifestyle, meme, POV

Product demos, explainers, social proof

Testimonials, objections, offers

4\. TikTok Ads

Platform Mindset

TikTok is **entertainment** **first,** **ads** **second**. The ad must
feel like content. Users reward content that feels native, human, and
unscripted. Ads that look like ads are ignored.

Buyer Intent Reality

> ● Mostly unaware or lightly problem-aware ● Emotion-led discovery
>
> ● Short attention span, high curiosity

Campaign Types (What They Actually Do)

Section 5: Tracking, Attribution & Signal Integrity

*(If* *tracking* *is* *wrong,* *every* *decision* *after* *is* *wrong)*

Paid media performance is only as good as the signals platforms receive.
Platforms do not optimize for truth. They optimize for **the** **data**
**you** **feed** **them**.

What Tracking Is Actually For

Tracking has three jobs, in this order:

> 1\. **Tell** **the** **platform** **what** **success** **looks**
> **like** 2. **Tell** **the** **marketer** **what** **actually**
> **happened** 3. **Create** **a** **feedback** **loop** **for**
> **optimization**

If any one of these breaks, scaling becomes guesswork.

Core Tracking Components (Universal)

Every paid setup should include all four/five layers:

> **Layer**
>
> Pixel / Base Tag
>
> Event Tracking
>
> Conversion API (CAPI)
>
> Mobile Attribution (MMP)
>
> Analytics Layer

**Purpose**

Page-level behavior tracking (web)

Key actions and intent signals

Server-side reliability and signal recovery

Install attribution, post-install events, fraud control

Cross-channel truth and analysis

**Examples**

Meta Pixel, Google Tag, LinkedIn Insight Tag

View content, add to cart, lead, purchase

Meta CAPI, Google Enhanced Conversions

Appsflyer, Adjust

GA4, Amplitude, Mixpanel

Rule: Pixels alone are no longer sufficient.

> ● Pixels and tags exist to train ad platforms, not to decide truth. ●
> For mobile apps, attribution authority belongs to the MMP.

󰗑 This is part of [**<u>MIA Marketing

Platform Pixels and Tags (What Each One Does)

> **Platform**
>
> Google
>
> Meta
>
> LinkedIn
>
> TikTok
>
> Reddit
>
> X
>
> Snapchat
>
> Mobile Apps (All Platforms)

**Tracking** **Tool**

Google Tag + Enhanced Conversions

Meta Pixel + Conversion API

Insight Tag

TikTok Pixel + Events API

Reddit Pixel

X Pixel

Snap Pixel

Appsflyer / Adjust (MMP)

**What** **It** **Feeds** **the** **Algorithm**

Keyword intent and conversion value

Behavioral optimization signals

Professional intent and retargeting

Creative engagement signals

Click and conversion feedback

Engagement and site actions

Mobile behavior and purchases

Install attribution, post-install events, fraud-filtered signals

Always verify:

> ● Pixel fires correctly
>
> ● Events are deduplicated
>
> ● For apps, platforms should receive events from the MMP, not define
> them independently ● Domains are verified where required

Event Design (What You Should Actually Track)

Avoid tracking everything. Track **meaningful** **intent**.

Events should be defined once, enforced centrally, and forwarded
outward.

> ● Web events originate from your site. ● App events originate from
> your MMP.

Recommended Event Hierarchy

> **Funnel** **Stage**
>
> TOFU
>
> MOFU
>
> BOFU

**Events**

View content, scroll depth

Product views, pricing views

Lead, demo, purchase

Assign **conversion** **values**, even if estimated. Platforms optimize
better with value signals than binary events.

> **Environment**
>
> Web
>
> Mobile App

**Event** **Authority**

Analytics + CAPI

Appsflyer / Adjust

**Why**

Highest flexibility and context

Install accuracy and post-install truth

Never allow each ad platform to define its own “conversion” for mobile
apps.

That creates conflicting truths and breaks optimization.

Attribution Models (How Credit Is Assigned)

No attribution model is “true.” Each is a lens.

> **Model**
>
> Last Click
>
> First Click
>
> Data-Driven
>
> Platform-Reported

**Best** **Use** **Case**

High-intent capture

Awareness evaluation

Mature accounts

Optimization feedback

**Risk**

Undervalues discovery

Overcredits early touch

Needs volume

Over-credits itself

Operating rule:

> ● Use **platform** **attribution** **to** **optimize** **delivery** ●
> Use **analytics** **attribution** **to** **decide** **spend**.
>
> ● Use **MMP** **attribution** **to** **decide** **app** **spend**.

Dealing With Attribution Gaps (Reality Check)

Expect under-reporting due to:

> ● iOS privacy ● Ad blockers
>
> ● Cross-device journeys

How to respond:

> ● Use blended metrics (MER, CAC trends)
>
> ○ Marketing Efficiency Ratio (MER) = Total Revenue / Total Ad Spend ●
> Watch directional movement, not precision
>
> ● Compare pre vs post exposure windows
>
> ● Use **MMP** **cohorts** (D7, D30 retention, revenue) instead of
> single-touch CPA for app decisions

Note:

> ● MMPs reduce attribution loss for mobile apps by reconciling
> installs, post-install events, and fraud.
>
> ● They do not eliminate privacy loss. They make it measurable and
> directional.

Validation and QA Checklist

Before scaling any campaign, confirm:

> ● Pixel installed on all pages ● Events firing correctly
>
> ● CAPI active and deduplicated
>
> ● Conversions appearing in ad platforms
>
> ● Analytics numbers are directionally aligned ● Appsflyer / Adjust SDK
> installed correctly
>
> ● Install attribution matches platform reports directionally ●
> Post-install events mapped correctly
>
> ● Events deduplicated between MMP and platform ● SKAdNetwork / privacy
> frameworks configured

Never scale on broken tracking.

The Signal Quality Rule

> <img src="./kixhe2ji.png"
> style="width:0.85417in;height:0.32292in" />[<u>🔐 Get full yearly
> access here →</u>](https://selar.com/marketingresources)

󰗑 This is part of [**<u>MIA Marketing
Resources</u>**](https://marketinginaction.xyz/resources/)

Bad data trains platforms to find the wrong people.

Who controls signal quality per environment:

> ● For web, signal quality is controlled by event design and CAPI. ●
> For apps, signal quality is controlled by the MMP.
>
> ● Feeding platforms low-quality app events trains them to find
> low-quality users.

If lead quality drops:

> ● Check event definitions
>
> ● Tighten conversion criteria
>
> ● Feed higher-quality signals upstream

Platforms follow incentives. Teach them carefully.

Section 6: Operational Execution OS

*(How* *campaigns* *are* *actually* *run* *day* *to* *day)*

1\. Testing Framework (What to Test, In What Order)

Testing is not “trying things.” It is controlled learning.

The Testing Priority Stack

Always test in this order:

> 1\. **Message**
>
> ○ Hook
>
> ○ Pain articulation ○ Value proposition
>
> 2\. **Creative** **format**
>
> ○ Video vs static
>
> ○ Demo vs POV vs testimonial 3. **Audience**
>
> ○ Cold vs warm
>
> ○ Broad vs narrow 4. **Bidding** **and** **optimization**
>
> ○ Only after creative and message are validated

Rule: If the message is wrong, no bid strategy will save you.

Single-Variable Testing Rule

Change **one** **variable** **at** **a** **time**:

> ● One hook ● One angle ● One format

Never change:

> ● Creative and targeting
>
> ● Creative and landing page in the same test cycle.

󰗑 This is part of [**<u>MIA Marketing
Resources</u>**](https://marketinginaction.xyz/resources/)

2\. Kill Rules (When to Stop)

Bad ads waste money quietly. Kill rules prevent emotional attachment.

Creative Kill Signals

Kill an ad if:

> ● CTR is **40–60%** **below** **account** **average** after learning ●
> CPC is rising while CTR is falling
>
> ● Engagement drops but frequency rises

Time-based rule:

> ● Cold ads: review after 3–5 days
>
> ● Retargeting ads: review after 48–72 hours

3\. Scale Rules (When to Push)

Scaling too early destroys signal.

Scale only when:

> ● CTR is stable or improving ● CPA is within target range
>
> ● Conversion rate is consistent

Safe Scaling Methods

> ● Increase budget by **20–30%** **every** **48** **hours** ● Duplicate
> winning ads into new audiences
>
> ● Expand placement, not message

Avoid:

> ● Doubling budgets overnight ● Editing winning creatives

4\. Creative Refresh Cadence

Creative decay is inevitable.

> **Funnel** **Stage**
>
> TOFU
>
> MOFU
>
> BOFU

**Refresh** **Rule**

Every 2–4 weeks

Every 1–2 weeks

Weekly or bi-weekly

Signals it’s time to refresh:

> ● Rising CPM ● Falling CTR ● Stable CVR

5\. Reading Signals Correctly (Don’t Misdiagnose)

Signal Interpretation Table

> **Symptom**
>
> High CTR, low conversions
>
> Low CTR, high CVR
>
> Rising CPA, stable CTR
>
> Flat performance

**Likely** **Cause**

Landing page mismatch

Weak hook

Auction pressure

Creative fatigue

**Fix**

Fix LP, not ads

Rewrite hook

Improve differentiation

Refresh angle

Rule: Metrics tell stories. Don’t read them in isolation.

Section 7: Scalable Growth OS

*(How* *teams* *scale* *without* *chaos)*

1\. Budget Allocation by Funnel Stage

Start with intent, then expand.

Typical Split (Early Stage)

> **Funnel** **Stage**
>
> BOFU (Search, Retargeting)
>
> MOFU (Demos, Education)
>
> TOFU (Awareness)

**%** **Budget**

40–50%

30–35%

15–25%

Growth Stage Adjustment

As data stabilizes, TOFU grows to feed MOFU.

2\. Cross-Platform Sequencing (How Platforms Work Together)

Paid media is not parallel. It is sequential.

Typical Flow

> 1\. **Meta** **/** **TikTok** **–** Create awareness and demand
> signals 2. **YouTube** **/** **LinkedIn** **–** Educate and build
> trust
>
> 3\. **Google** **Search** **–** Capture demand
>
> 4\. **Retargeting** **everywhere** **–** Reinforce belief and remove
> friction

3\. Learning Transfer Between Platforms

Do not relearn the same lessons.

󰗑 This is part of [**<u>MIA Marketing
Resources</u>**](https://marketinginaction.xyz/resources/)

What Transfers Well

> ● Hooks
>
> ● Pain language ● Objections
>
> ● Proof formats

What Does Not Transfer

> ● Visual styles ● Length
>
> ● Tone

Example:

> ● A winning Meta hook becomes: ○ Google headline
>
> ○ LinkedIn opening line
>
> ○ YouTube opening statement

4\. Avoiding Platform Silos (Critical)

Most teams fail here.

Structural Fixes

> ● One shared creative library
>
> ● Weekly cross-platform review
>
> ● One owner per message, not per platform

Operating Rule

Platforms execute differently. **Strategy** **stays** **centralized.**

Final Operating Principle

If your team:

> ● Tests deliberately ● Kills unemotionally

Paid Marketing Operating Checklist

*(Use* *this* *every* *time* *you* *plan,* *launch,* *or* *review* *a*
*campaign)*

SECTION 1: Strategic Clarity Check

*(From* *Universal* *Principles)*

Before touching a platform, confirm:

> I can state **what** **this** **ad** **is** **filtering** **for**, not
> selling This ad moves the user **one** **step**, not the whole funnel
> I know whether this is an **interruption** or **invitation** ad The ad
> targets **one** **awareness** **level** **only**
>
> Unaware Problem-aware Solution-aware Product-aware Most-aware
>
> The message has **one** **core** **promise** The CTA matches the
> audience’s mindset
>
> I can clearly articulate the **cost** **of** **inaction**
> Differentiation is based on **framing**, not features

**If** **unclear** **here,** **stop.** **Ads** **amplify**
**confusion.**

SECTION 2: Funnel Alignment Check

*(Creative* *Selection* *Starts* *With* *Funnel* *Stage)*

> This campaign is clearly:
>
> TOFU (attention + problem recognition) MOFU (belief + preference)
>
> BOFU (friction removal + action) The creative type matches the funnel
> stage

> I am not running BOFU creatives to cold traffic I can explain **what**
> **belief** **must** **change** **next**

SECTION 3: Creative Strategy Check

*(Creative* *Types* *by* *Strategic* *Role)*

For each creative in the campaign:

> I know the **strategic** **role** of this creative Pain point
>
> Cost of inaction Product demo How-to / explainer Testimonial
>
> Case study Founder story Category framing Objection handling Thought
> leadership Interview
>
> Lifestyle Meme / humor
>
> I know **why** **this** **format** **is** **chosen**, not just that it
> “works” The structure follows the correct pattern for that creative
> type The platform is a **natural** **fit** for this creative
>
> I am not forcing a format onto the wrong platform

SECTION 4: Platform Fit Check

*(Platform-Specific* *Playbooks)*

Before launch, confirm:

> I understand the **platform** **mindset**
>
> I understand the **buyer** **intent** **reality**
>
> The campaign type matches what the platform actually does Creative
> matches platform-native behavior

> Specs (dimensions, length, text limits) are correct I reviewed real
> ads in the platform’s **ads** **library**

If this feels like “Meta but resized,” it is wrong.

SECTION 5: Tracking & Attribution Check

*(Tracking,* *Attribution* *&* *Signal* *Integrity)*

**Tracking** **Setup**

> Pixel / base tag installed correctly
>
> Conversion API (CAPI) active and deduplicated Events are firing and
> verified
>
> Domains verified where required

**Web** **vs** **App**

> Web events originate from site + CAPI
>
> App events originate from **Appsflyer** **/** **Adjust** **(MMP)**
> Platforms receive app events from the MMP, not independently

**Events**

> TOFU events track meaningful engagement MOFU events reflect intent
>
> BOFU events represent real value
>
> Conversion values are assigned where possible

**Attribution**

> Platform attribution used for **optimization** Analytics used for
> **decision-making** MMP used as **authority** **for** **app**
> **spend**
>
> I am watching **directional** **trends**, not perfection

Never scale on broken tracking .

> priority follows:
>
> Message Creative format Audience Bidding
>
> Learning objective is defined before launch

**Kill** **Rules**

> Kill thresholds are set
>
> I will not keep ads “because they might work later”

**Scaling**

> Scaling only after signal stability Budget increases capped at 20–30%
> I will not edit winning creatives

**Creative** **Refresh**

> TOFU refresh cadence planned MOFU refresh cadence planned BOFU refresh
> cadence planned

**Signal** **Reading**

> Platforms are sequenced, not siloed Learning is transferred across
> platforms Creative insights are centralized
>
> One owner exists per **message**, not per platform

Paid media scales when learning compounds .
