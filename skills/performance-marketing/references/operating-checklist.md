Paid Marketing Operating Checklist

*(Use* *this* *every* *time* *you* *plan,* *launch,* *or* *review* *a*
*campaign)*

SECTION 1: Strategic Clarity Check

*(From* *Universal* *Principles)*

Before touching a platform, confirm:

> I can state **what** **this** **ad** **is** **filtering** **for**, not
> selling This ad moves the user **one** **step**, not the whole funnel
> I know whether this is an **interruption** or **invitation** ad The ad
> targets **one** **awareness** **level** **only**
>
> Unaware Problem-aware Solution-aware Product-aware Most-aware
>
> The message has **one** **core** **promise** The CTA matches the
> audience’s mindset
>
> I can clearly articulate the **cost** **of** **inaction**
> Differentiation is based on **framing**, not features

**If** **unclear** **here,** **stop.** **Ads** **amplify**
**confusion.**

SECTION 2: Funnel Alignment Check

*(Creative* *Selection* *Starts* *With* *Funnel* *Stage)*

> This campaign is clearly:
>
> TOFU (attention + problem recognition) MOFU (belief + preference)
>
> BOFU (friction removal + action) The creative type matches the funnel
> stage

Resources</u>**](https://marketinginaction.xyz/resources/)

> I am not running BOFU creatives to cold traffic I can explain **what**
> **belief** **must** **change** **next**

SECTION 3: Creative Strategy Check

*(Creative* *Types* *by* *Strategic* *Role)*

For each creative in the campaign:

> I know the **strategic** **role** of this creative Pain point
>
> Cost of inaction Product demo How-to / explainer Testimonial
>
> Case study Founder story Category framing Objection handling Thought
> leadership Interview
>
> Lifestyle Meme / humor
>
> I know **why** **this** **format** **is** **chosen**, not just that it
> “works” The structure follows the correct pattern for that creative
> type The platform is a **natural** **fit** for this creative
>
> I am not forcing a format onto the wrong platform

SECTION 4: Platform Fit Check

*(Platform-Specific* *Playbooks)*

Before launch, confirm:

> I understand the **platform** **mindset**
>
> I understand the **buyer** **intent** **reality**
>
> The campaign type matches what the platform actually does Creative
> matches platform-native behavior

> Specs (dimensions, length, text limits) are correct I reviewed real
> ads in the platform’s **ads** **library**

If this feels like “Meta but resized,” it is wrong.

SECTION 5: Tracking & Attribution Check

*(Tracking,* *Attribution* *&* *Signal* *Integrity)*

**Tracking** **Setup**

> Pixel / base tag installed correctly
>
> Conversion API (CAPI) active and deduplicated Events are firing and
> verified
>
> Domains verified where required

**Web** **vs** **App**

> Web events originate from site + CAPI
>
> App events originate from **Appsflyer** **/** **Adjust** **(MMP)**
> Platforms receive app events from the MMP, not independently

**Events**

> TOFU events track meaningful engagement MOFU events reflect intent
>
> BOFU events represent real value
>
> Conversion values are assigned where possible

**Attribution**

> Platform attribution used for **optimization** Analytics used for
> **decision-making** MMP used as **authority** **for** **app**
> **spend**
>
> I am watching **directional** **trends**, not perfection

Never scale on broken tracking .

> priority follows:
>
> Message Creative format Audience Bidding
>
> Learning objective is defined before launch

**Kill** **Rules**

> Kill thresholds are set
>
> I will not keep ads “because they might work later”

**Scaling**

> Scaling only after signal stability Budget increases capped at 20–30%
> I will not edit winning creatives

**Creative** **Refresh**

> TOFU refresh cadence planned MOFU refresh cadence planned BOFU refresh
> cadence planned

**Signal** **Reading**

> I know how to diagnose CTR vs CVR vs CPA I won’t misattribute landing
> page issues to ads

> Platforms are sequenced, not siloed Learning is transferred across
> platforms Creative insights are centralized
>
> One owner exists per **message**, not per platform

Paid media scales when learning compounds .
