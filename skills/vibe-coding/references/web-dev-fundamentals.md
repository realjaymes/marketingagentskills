# Website & Web App Development for Beginners

**James Praise | Marketing In Action**

## What You Are Learning
Modern web development combines four systems:
1. Frontend code (browser)
2. Backend code (server)
3. Databases
4. Deployment and hosting

These are one connected system, not separate skills.

## Core Building Blocks
A web app consists of:
- Frontend
- Backend
- Database
- GitHub (source of truth)
- Deployment platforms

## Frontend Fundamentals

### HTML
Defines structure and elements.

### CSS
Controls layout, spacing, and design.

### JavaScript
Adds interactivity and behavior.

### Frameworks (Later)
React, Vue, Next.js for scaling complexity.

## Content Management Systems (CMS)
CMS tools manage content without editing code.

Examples:
- WordPress
- Webflow
- Ghost
- Contentful
- Sanity

Use CMS after learning HTML and CSS basics.

## From Figma to Code
Figma provides visual structure, not code.
Translate designs by identifying:
- Sections
- Containers
- Reusable components

Build HTML first, then CSS.

## Backend Fundamentals
Backends:
- Receive requests
- Apply rules
- Communicate with databases

Beginner stacks:
- Node.js + Express
- Python + Flask or Django

## APIs
Frontend and backend communicate over HTTP:
- GET
- POST

## Databases
Beginner options:
- SQLite
- PostgreSQL
- Supabase
- Firebase

Focus on CRUD operations.

## GitHub
GitHub is:
- Version history
- Collaboration layer
- Deployment trigger

## Domains and Hosting
- Domain = address
- Hosting = server

Common tools:
- Netlify
- Vercel
- GitHub Pages

## Deployment
Deployment makes your app public.
- Frontend: Netlify, Vercel
- Backend: Render, Railway, Fly.io

## Learning Path

### Phase 1: Websites
Static multi-page sites.

### Phase 2: Interactivity
JavaScript-driven UI.

### Phase 3: Content Sites
CMS-driven projects.

### Phase 4: Learning Platforms
Structured content systems.

### Phase 5: Web Apps
Backend + database.

### Phase 6: Ecommerce & Marketplaces
Payments, listings, users.

### Phase 7: Deployment Mastery
Domains, CI/CD, environments.

## First Recommended Project
Build and deploy a multi-page portfolio site, then upgrade it with a backend contact form.

## Core Rule
Finish one complete project before starting another.
Shipped projects teach systems thinking.
