**James Praise x Marketing In Action**

## Product Launch Tiers & Priority Matrix

### Axes
Customer Impact: Retention vs Acquisition  
Market Innovation: Parity vs Differentiated

## Quadrant Definitions

### Priority #1
Innovative and wins new customers. Requires full GTM execution.

### Priority #2
Innovative for existing customers or parity features that unblock acquisition.

### Priority #3
Market-matching, retention-focused updates. Low GTM effort.

## Channel Activation Logic
Channels should be activated conditionally based on launch priority, not by default.
