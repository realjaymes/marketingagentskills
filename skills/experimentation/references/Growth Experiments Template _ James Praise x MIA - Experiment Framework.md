# Growth Experiments Template _ James Praise x MIA - Experiment Framework

Growth Experiments Tracker Template by James Praise x Marketing In Action
Step Details
Begin your experiment framework by stating the observation that sparked the decision to run an experiment. Keep this simple, informative, and to-the-point.
Observation Example: Recently, we have seen a decline in conversion rate on our content offers. Last month, we added two additional required fields to the landing page form.
Add structure to your experiment by writing out what goal you are trying to accomplish, such as to improve a specific metric or answer a question that you have.
Objective Example: Our goal is to increase the average landing page conversion rate.
Create a measurable hypothesis and your expected outcome. Use this format:
By doing X, we believe Y will happen. If we are right, we expect Z.
Example: By reducing the number of required form fields, we believe we can reverse the recent 15% drop in conversion rate. If we are right, we expect at least a 10% increase in
Hypothesis conversion rate over the current 18% baseline, returning us closer to the original 22%.
Break this into Control and Test to clearly outline your experiment’s structure.
Control: Describe the existing setup (baseline). Example: Existing form with 6 fields including two new required ones added last month.
Experiment Design Test: Detail the changes and timeline. Example: Create a variant form with only 4 required fields and redesigned layout to appear shorter. Run an A/B test over a 30-day window.
A/B Testing Notes (Design) Use tools like abtestguide.com/abtestsize to calculate sample size (e.g. 10,000 unique visitors), conversion rate (e.g. 4%), expected uplift (e.g. 15%), and test duration (e.g. 4 weeks).
List any open questions, dependencies, or cross-functional inputs that could affect the experiment.
Considerations Examples: Does the design team have bandwidth? Are other teams seeing similar results? Could autofill issues be affecting performance?
Define clear, quantifiable success metrics.
Success Criteria Example: A statistically significant relative improvement of at least 10% in conversion rate over the control (e.g., from 18% to 19.8%).
Your monthly traffic and conversion rates must align with uplift thresholds.
Min 1,000 conversions/month for 15% lift.
Min 10,000 conversions/month for 5% lift.
A/B Testing Notes (Success) Target timeframe: 1–4 weeks with 95% confidence.
With your success criteria in mind, state how you will measure the results.
Measurement Example: Results tracked using HubSpot's A/B testing tool. Compare control vs. test performance and track downstream metrics like MQL quality.
Compare control vs. test data side-by-side.
Confirm statistical significance with built-in or third-party calculators.
A/B Testing Notes (Measurement) Track both primary (form conversion) and secondary (MQL quality) metrics.
After the experiment, summarize learnings.
Results & Learnings Example: The test showed a 5% increase in conversion at 95% confidence. Though it didn’t meet the 10% goal, it suggests layout simplification has impact and should be iterated on.
