Growth Experiment Framework Template
Workbook: Growth Experiments Template | James Praise x MIA
Observation
Begin your experiment framework by stating the observation that sparked the decision to run an experiment. Keep this simple, informative, and to-the-point.
Recently, we have seen a decline in conversion rate on our content offers. Last month, we added two additional required fields to the landing page form.
Objective
Add structure to your experiment by writing out what goal you are trying to accomplish, such as to improve a specific metric or answer a question that you have.
Our goal is to increase the average landing page conversion rate.
Hypothesis
Based on your observation and objective, create a measurable hypothesis and your expected outcome. Use this format:
By doing X, we believe Y will happen. If we are right, we expect Z.
As your experimentation maturity grows, your hypotheses should become more precise and based on prior learnings.
By reducing the number of required form fields, we believe we can reverse the recent 15% drop in conversion rate.
If we are right, we expect at least a 10% increase in conversion rate over the current 18% baseline, returning us closer to the original 22%.

Experiment Design
Break this into Control and Test to clearly outline your experiment’s structure.
Control: Describe the existing setup (baseline). This is what your test will be compared against.
Existing form with 6 fields including two new required ones added last month.
Test: Detail the changes, how they will be implemented, and for how long. Mention if you’re using A/B testing or another experimentation method.
Create a variant form with only 4 required fields and redesigned layout to appear shorter. Run an A/B test on multiple landing pages over a 30-day window.
A/B Testing Notes
Use tools like abtestguide.com/abtestsize to calculate sample size (e.g. 10,000 unique visitors), conversion rate (e.g. 4%), expected uplift (e.g. 15%), and test
duration (e.g. 4 weeks).
Considerations
List any open questions, dependencies, or cross-functional inputs that could affect the execution or interpretation of the experiment.
Does the design team have bandwidth to create the new form?
Are other teams using this form and are they seeing similar results?
Could a technical issue (e.g. autofill not working) be affecting performance?
Success Criteria
Define clear, quantifiable success metrics.
A statistically significant relative improvement of at least 10% in conversion rate over the control (e.g., from 18% to 19.8%).
A/B Testing Notes
Your monthly traffic volume and conversion rates must align with your required uplift thresholds.
Min 1,000 conversions/month to detect a 15% lift.
Min 10,000 conversions/month to detect a 5% lift.

The shorter your timeframe (1–4 weeks), at a 95% confidence level, the more actionability your results will have.
Measurement
With your success criteria in mind, state how you will measure the results of the experiment.
Results will be tracked using HubSpot's A/B testing tool. We'll compare control vs. test performance using conversion rate and assess statistical significance. We’ll
primarily track form conversion rates. In parallel, we’ll monitor downstream metrics like MQL quality to ensure improved conversion doesn’t sacrifice lead value.
A/B Testing Notes
Compare control vs. test data points side-by-side.
Confirm statistical significance using built-in or third-party calculators.
Track both the primary metric (e.g., form conversion) and secondary funnel metrics (e.g., MQL quality) to ensure the test doesn’t negatively impact downstream
behavior.
Results & Learnings
Once your experiment has been executed and the results have been analyzed, detail here the learnings you have from the experiment.
The experiment produced a 5% increase in conversion rate with 95% confidence. Although the result didn’t meet our 10% target, the 5% uplift suggests that layout
simplification has a positive impact. We’ll incorporate this learning into future form optimizations.

ICEEE Prioritization Framework
The ICEEE framework is designed to help growth teams evaluate and prioritize experiments based on their potential upside and the effort required to
execute them. It incorporates five dimensions:
Impact - How big of an improvement could this experiment drive?
Confidence - How confident are we in the experiment's success?
Effort - Engineering - How much engineering time will it require?
Effort - Marketing - What lift is required from the marketing team?
Effort - Other - Any additional resources needed (e.g., operations, product, etc.)
Each dimension is scored based on a predefined index:
Impact Index Confidence Index Effort Index
1: Unknown or minimal 1: Not confident 1: Less than ½ day
2-4: Small, 1-10% relative gain 2: Somewhat confident 2: ½ to 1 day
5-8: Medium, 10%-25% relative g 3: Moderately confident 3: 1-2 days
9-10: Large/Huge, +25% relative 4: Very confident 4: 2-4 days
5: Extremely confident 5: 5-10 days
ICEEE Weighted Score Formula
To prioritize experiments, we calculate a weighted score as follows:
Score = ((Impact + Confidence) * 2) - (Engineering Effort * 2) - Marketing Effort - Other Effort

Why this formula?
Impact and Confidence are amplified by a factor of 2 to emphasize the value of experiments with high potential and good supporting rationale.
Engineering Effort is penalized more heavily (also x2) because engineering time is usually the most scarce and costly resource.
Marketing and Other Efforts are included with a lighter weight to reflect their lower impact on opportunity cost.
This weighting helps surface high-leverage, low-lift experiments that can be executed quickly and confidently.
