# MIA Positioning Framework Example

Last Update: January 2026

## POSITIONING STATEMENT

For **marketers, startup founders**, and GTM leaders who **need practical, community-driven ways to execute Product Marketing, Growth & GTM strategies**,

**Marketing In Action (MIA)** is a **marketing media (newsletter, podcast, events), community & education platform (MIA Academy)** that delivers **actionable insights, proven frameworks, ready-to-use templates, martech/GTM tools and structured learning to execute Product Marketing, Growth & GTM strategies**.

Unlike **generic marketing newsletters or paid marketing programs, platforms and communities**, which focus on theory gated behind a paywall, MIA **combines media, peer-driven community, and applied education into one ecosystem where marketers learn in public, practice in real scenarios, and grow their careers with clarity**.
