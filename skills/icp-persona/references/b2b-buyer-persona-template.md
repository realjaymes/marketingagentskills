# B2B Buyer Persona Template

Buyers could be anyone. In some businesses, it's the CEO, others, Marketing Directors and others again, Chief Financial Officers. It's on you to first find who that person is and then you can build out your buyer persona.

## Example: Jane Doe (CFO Buyer Persona)

### JANE DOE

### Why won't they buy?

Because she's not convinced of the ROI. If a claim doesn't meet the company's expense requirements, nine times out of 10, it'll get turned down.

### What closes the deal?

Value for money every time. If we can prove our product will save or make the company more than it costs, we have our foot in the door.

### Communication preferences

Jane isn't involved in the research phase. Individuals or departments approach her once they have made a decision and she then ensures feasibility.

Often, colleagues don't come to her with all the detail needed, she prefers a simple one-pager packed with all the pricing, data and recommendations she needs in one place. We should provide users with this information to forward on to Jane.
