# B2C User Persona Template

Using a make-belief travel company, here's what we're aiming for with your end result.

## Example: John Doe (Family Traveler Persona)

### JOHN DOE

| Section | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Bio** | John is a sun-seeker and looks forward to his family's summer vacation every year. With kids to fork out for, price is a sticking point, and trawling through pages upon pages of deals definitely doesn't appeal to him. He wants something that's affordable, easy to find and totally trusted. |
| **Personal details** | Age: 35-55-years-old, Job: Accountant, Income: $90,000, Education: Bachelors, Location: Australia, New Zealand |
| **Interests** | John is a family man, has an avid passion for travel and goes on holiday every summer. He has been in the same job for a long time, works a standard 9-5, and would describe himself as active. |

### Goals

- Continue annual holidays with his family
- Travel further afield when his kids are grown up
- Spend less time and money booking trips

### Emotional drivers

John loves being able to spoil his family once a year and create lots of new memories. As long as it fits his budget though. He's savvy with his money and gives himself a pat on the back when he bags a good deal.

### Barriers

- Going abroad with children gets expensive
- Researching holidays can be time-consuming
- He doesn't know which booking sites should and shouldn't be trusted
- He doesn't like the thought of long haul flights with his kids

### Personality

- Active
- Analytical
- Loyal

### Motivators

- Money
- Simplicity
- Trustworthiness
- Family-friendly

### Purchase path

John usually starts looking for summer vacations in January but pays attention to deals all-year-round. He does his research primarily online using comparison sites and never makes a purchase without reading reviews.

### Communication preferences

John isn't a social media man. He prefers to be contacted by email or post and isn't a fan of videos, webinars or podcasts, either.

### Messaging

When we speak to John, we must always elicit trust, focus on financial feasibility and share only deals that are family-friendly.

**For example:**
"Being a family man shouldn't mean you miss out on awesome adventures and with our scorching hot deals, it doesn't. Join 1,000s of other sun-seekers who save with us and bag yourself a summer bargain today."
