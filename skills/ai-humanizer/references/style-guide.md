# Write Like a Human – AI Style Guide

Complete reference for humanizing AI-written text.

---

## Voice & Tone

- **Curious & Explorative:** Write as if actively learning and processing information
- **Thoughtful:** Take time to consider different angles rather than presenting definitive answers
- **Conversational:** Use "I" and "you" liberally in a natural way
- **Balanced:** Present multiple perspectives before offering your synthesis
- **Intellectually Humble:** Acknowledge the limits of your knowledge and experience
- **Practical:** Focus on applicable insights rather than abstract theory
- **Simple:** No jargon for jargon's sake. Keep language simple, direct, and relatable

## Core Writing Principles

### Lead with the Result
Start with the outcome, number, name, or decision, not the setup.

**Bad:** "After extensive research and development, we created a tool that..."
**Good:** "Teams reply to customers 3x faster with our tool."

### Replace Labels with Proof
Don't say "world-class." Show the metrics.

**Bad:** "Our world-class support team..."
**Good:** "Our support team responds in under 2 minutes on average."

### Name the Audience
Instead of "businesses of all sizes," specify who.

**Bad:** "Perfect for businesses of all sizes."
**Good:** "Built for Series A SaaS companies with 10-50 employees."

### Cut Filler and Hedges
Remove "in order to," "going forward," "kind of," "very."

### Use Active Voice by Default
"We launched the feature," not "The feature was launched."

### Avoid Cliche Openings
Never start with "In today's world..." or "Let's dive in."

### Keep Sentences Under ~24 Words
Prefer clarity over cleverness.

## Usage of Dashes

**Primary rule:** Avoid dashes unless absolutely necessary. Prefer commas, periods, or conjunctions.

**Maximum:** One dash per complete piece of copy (when unavoidable).

### Dash Types

| Type | Usage | Example |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Hyphen (-)** | Connect compound words | well-being, user-friendly |
| **En dash ( – )** | Ranges or connections (with spaces) | June – August, New York – London |
| **Em dash (—)** | Sharp break or abrupt change (no spaces) | I saw him yesterday—he looked great |

## Words and Phrases to Avoid

### Structural Patterns

| Pattern | Example | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Question sentences | "The result? Improved conversions." | "This led to improved conversions." |
| X/Y juxtapositions | "It's not just about features, it's about benefits." | "Features matter less than benefits." |
| "Stop X. Start Y." | "Stop guessing. Start knowing." | Rewrite into one measurable statement |
| Em-dash overuse | "We built it—and it works" | Use periods for separate sentences |

### Generic Business Jargon

Avoid: "leverage," "utilize," "synergy," "game-changer," "paradigm shift"

### Intro Phrases

Avoid: "picture this," "in the realm of," "in the world of"

### False Urgency

Avoid: "you need to," "you must," "essential"

### Vague Qualifiers

Avoid: "very," "really," "quite," "actually"

### Cliche Transitions

Avoid: "at the end of the day," "when all is said and done"

### Command Phrasing (Always AI-like)

Avoid: "Remember," "Keep in mind," "Don't forget"

### Filler Openers

Avoid: "It's time to...," "Let's dive in," "The future of X is here"

## Buzzword Replacement Guide

| Instead of... | Write... |
|---------------|----------|
| "In today's digital landscape" | State the concrete context or feature |
| "Game-changer" / "Next-gen" | Show the change numerically or specifically |
| "Whether you're a beginner or a pro" | Split paths for each audience |
| "X made easy" | Explain how it's easier ("Complete in under 10 minutes") |
| "Transform your workflow" | "Cut steps from 5 to 2; lead time drops 38%" |
| "Seamless," "robust," "intuitive" | Describe what makes them so |
| "World-class" | Show the metric or example |

## How to Sound Genuinely Human

### Use Contractions
"I'm," "you're," "doesn't," "can't"

### Include Occasional Asides
(like this) or [a quick note]

### Reference Specific Dates/Times
"Last Tuesday" not "Recently"

### Mention Places by Name
"When I was working from that coffee shop in Victoria Island" not "When I was working remotely"

### Include Imperfections
Admit uncertainty when appropriate:
- "I'm not sure"
- "It depends"
- "In my case..."

### Vary Sentence Structure
Mix simple statements with more complex thoughts

### Use Cultural References
Books, shows, or events your audience would recognize

### Share Genuine Reactions
"This absolutely floored me" or "I couldn't believe how simple the solution was"

### Use Active, Concrete Verbs
Show what's happening, not just what's being discussed

### Prefer Specifics Over Abstractions
Name tools, data, or people when relevant

### Replace Buzzwords with Real Proof
Metrics, examples, or screenshots

### Be Inclusive and Bias-Free
Use "team" or "everyone" instead of gendered terms

### End Sections with Impact
Leave the reader with an insight or action, not a fade

---

## Sentence and Paragraph Structure

### Begin with Strong Statements
Start paragraphs with clear, concise claims

### Create Rhythm
Alternate between short, punchy sentences and more detailed explanations

Short. Punchy. Direct.

Then follow with something that expands on the idea and provides the context your reader needs to fully understand what you're saying.

### One Idea Per Paragraph
Keep paragraphs focused on a single thought

### End with Impact
Conclude sections with insights or provocative thoughts

### Use Natural Transitions
Connect ideas organically rather than with formulaic phrases

### Embrace White Space
Short paragraphs create visual breathing room
