## Key Insights from PLG Leaders

### Smooth Onboarding Increases Activation
Products use guided onboarding (checklists, tooltips, progress bars) to drive users to the "aha moment" quickly. Simplifying initial setup reduces friction.

**Principles:** Commitment, Momentum, Simplicity

### Freemium & Trial Tactics Create Urgency
Many offer a free tier with strict limits or time-limited trials to let users experience value, then leverage loss aversion by threatening to cut off access if they don't upgrade.

**Principles:** Proof of Value, Loss Aversion

### In-App Prompts and Emails Nudge Upgrades
Persistent upgrade banners, tooltips, and alerts remind users of paid plan benefits or approaching limits. Timely email sequences provide value while moving users toward conversion.

**Principles:** Attention, Momentum, Trust

### Human Touch Increases High-Value Conversions
Founder emails, personal onboarding offers, and concierge support build trust and address concerns that self-serve cannot.

**Principles:** Trust, Authority, Commitment

### Usage-Based Triggers Convert Better Than Time-Based
Upgrades triggered by actual usage (hitting limits, using premium features) convert better than arbitrary time deadlines because they align with demonstrated value.

**Principles:** Proof of Value, Relevance, Timing

**What to do:**

### 8. In-App Upgrade Banner with Usage Stats

**Principle:** Loss Aversion, Momentum

**What to do:**
- Show persistent (but non-intrusive) upgrade prompts
- Display usage statistics (forms created, responses received, limits approaching)
- Frame upgrades as unlocking more of what they already value

**Why it works:**
Keeps the goal visible while demonstrating the value they would lose.

---

### 9. Urgency and Incentive at Trial End

**Principle:** Loss Aversion, Timing

**What to do:**
- Send trial expiration reminders at 3 days, 1 day, and same-day
- Offer a limited-time discount or extended trial for engagement

- Offer personal onboarding calls or white-glove setup

**Why it works:**
Personal investment from your team signals that you're invested in their success.

## Conversion Optimization Framework

### Diagnose Before Optimizing

Before running experiments, identify where conversion breaks down:

1. **Signup → First action** - Are users getting started?
2. **First action → Aha moment** - Do they experience core value?
3. **Aha moment → Habit** - Do they return and engage repeatedly?
4. **Habit → Upgrade** - Do they hit natural upgrade triggers?

Focus experiments on the weakest link in this chain.

### Measurement Guidelines

Track these metrics for each experiment:

- **Activation rate** - % of signups who complete key action
- **Trial engagement** - Average actions per trial user
- **Upgrade rate** - % of trials who convert to paid
- **Time to upgrade** - Days from signup to paid conversion
- **Expansion revenue** - Upgrades within first 90 days

### Prioritization

Evaluate experiments against:

1. **Expected impact** - How much could conversion improve?
2. **Confidence** - How sure are you this will work?
3. **Effort** - Engineering, design, and content requirements
4. **Learning value** - What will you learn even if it fails?

Run 1-2 experiments at a time. Measure for full trial cycle before declaring results.
