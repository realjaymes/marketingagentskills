## Key Insights from PLG Leaders

### Product Exposure Creates Compounding Awareness
The best PLG brands bake distribution into the product via shareable artifacts, templates, or "powered by" surfaces that turn usage into discovery.

**Principles:** Distribution, Compounding

### Template SEO Beats Generic Blogging
Template libraries and example galleries capture high-intent searches and help prospects visualize outcomes fast.

**Principles:** Relevance, Clarity, Proof Over Promise

### Integrations Become an Organic Acquisition Channel
Ecosystem listings and integration pages pull in motivated buyers already searching for "Tool A + Tool B" solutions. Reviews in those ecosystems function as instant trust.

**Principles:** Timing, Social Proof, Authority

### Authority Content Wins Attention Without Paid Spend
Deep educational content, benchmarks, and playbooks earn backlinks, shares, and repeat exposure, creating familiarity that later converts.

**Principles:** Attention, Authority, Familiarity

### Revenue-Focused Positioning Outperforms Feature Marketing
When the narrative is tied to business outcomes (lead quality, routing, enrichment, CRM sync, removing bottlenecks), it reframes from "nice tool" to "revenue infrastructure."

**Principles:** Category, Differentiation, Value Translation

## Prioritization Framework

When selecting experiments, evaluate against:

1. **Current stage** - Early stage favors organic/PLG tactics; growth stage can layer paid
2. **Resource constraints** - Some experiments require engineering; others are marketing-only
3. **Existing strengths** - Double down on what already shows traction
4. **Competitive gaps** - Where are competitors weak or absent?

Start with 2-3 experiments. Run for 4-8 weeks before evaluating. Compound winners rather than constantly testing new things.
