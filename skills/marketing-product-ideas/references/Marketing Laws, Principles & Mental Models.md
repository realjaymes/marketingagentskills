# Marketing Laws, Principles & Mental Models

## Overview

There is no single, agreed-upon number of marketing laws or principles. Marketing principles are not like physical laws. They are patterns observed over time, named and grouped by different thinkers, often overlapping or reworded across books, frameworks, and disciplines.

**The clearest way to think about it:** There are hundreds of named marketing laws and principles, but only a few dozen core ideas that keep reappearing under different names.

## Why the Number Varies

Marketing principles come from different sources:
- Psychology
- Economics
- Behavioral science
- Advertising
- Branding
- Sales
- Strategy

Each author curates their own set, often renaming similar ideas to fit their thesis.

### Well-Known Collections

- **22 Immutable Laws of Marketing** by Ries and Trout
- **7 Principles of Influence** by Cialdini
- **Mental Models** popularized by Farnam Street and Charlie Munger
- **Behavioral Biases** documented by Kahneman and Tversky
- Brand Laws, Growth Laws, Pricing Laws, Conversion Laws, etc.

If you aggregate these, you quickly exceed 150-300 named "laws," many of which describe the same underlying behavior.

### The Reality Beneath the Lists

Most marketing laws collapse into a smaller set of fundamentals:
- Attention is scarce
- Humans rely on shortcuts
- Perception beats reality
- Context shapes value
- Trust compounds
- Consistency reduces friction
- Momentum reinforces itself
- Loss feels stronger than gain

Everything else is a variation, application, or reframing of these ideas.

### Practical Takeaway

You do not need to memorize hundreds of laws. Strong marketers internalize:
- 10-20 core principles
- How they show up across channels, products, and markets
- How to apply them situationally, not mechanically

Marketing rewards understanding patterns, not collecting frameworks.

## The 5-Layer Marketing Mental Model

Think of marketing as five layers, moving from the human brain outward to the market.

### Layer 1: Human Reality (Psychology)

Everything starts here. This layer explains why marketing works or fails.

**Core truths:**
- Attention is scarce
- Humans rely on shortcuts, not analysis
- Emotion drives action, logic justifies it later
- Loss feels stronger than gain
- Familiarity creates comfort

**This layer absorbs:**
- Cialdini's Influence principles
- Behavioral biases (loss aversion, anchoring, social proof)
- Scarcity, urgency, authority, reciprocity
- The Mere Exposure Effect

**Key question:** What belief, emotion, or perceived risk is controlling the buyer's decision right now, and are we reducing it or triggering it?

**If you ignore this:** No amount of traffic, spend, or tactics will save you.

---

### Layer 2: Perception & Meaning (Positioning)

Marketing does not happen in your product. It happens in the buyer's mind.

**Core truths:**
- Perception beats reality
- The mind compares before it decides
- Categories matter more than features
- First impressions anchor everything else

**This layer absorbs:**
- Ries & Trout's positioning laws
- Category creation
- "Better vs different"
- Brand framing
- Competitive context

**Key question:** What does the buyer think this is, and what do they compare it against?

**If you lose here:** You compete on price or noise.

---

### Layer 3: Value Translation (Messaging)

Value only exists if it is understood.

**Core truths:**
- Features do not sell. Outcomes do.
- Clarity beats persuasion
- Specific beats clever
- Relevance beats reach

**This layer absorbs:**
- Jobs to Be Done
- Value propositions
- Copywriting principles
- Objection handling
- Benefits over features

**Key question:** Can a stranger understand why this matters to them in under five seconds?

**If not:** Conversion friction explodes.

---

### Layer 4: Friction & Momentum (Conversion)

Growth is usually blocked, not missing.

**Core truths:**
- Every extra step kills momentum
- Trust compounds, doubt compounds faster
- Small frictions multiply across funnels
- Momentum reinforces itself

**This layer absorbs:**
- CRO laws
- Funnel optimization
- Activation principles
- Onboarding psychology
- Habit formation

**Key question:** Where is energy leaking in the journey?

**Reality:** Most "growth problems" are friction problems in disguise.

---

### Layer 5: Distribution & Scale (Market)

Only now do channels matter.

**Core truths:**
- Distribution beats invention
- Channels saturate over time
- What works early stops working later
- Leverage compounds asymmetrically

**This layer absorbs:**
- Growth loops
- Virality
- SEO, paid media, partnerships
- Network effects
- Flywheels

**Key question:** How does this grow without proportional effort?

**Reality:** Scale comes from systems, not campaigns.

---

## The Unifying Principle

All marketing laws are variations of this sequence:

**Human psychology → Perception → Meaning → Friction → Distribution**

When something fails, it always breaks at one layer, never all of them.

---

## How to Use This Model in Practice

When diagnosing a problem, do not jump to tactics. Ask, in order:

1. Is this fighting human psychology?
2. Is the positioning unclear or crowded?
3. Is the value poorly translated?
4. Is friction killing momentum?
5. Is distribution mismatched or saturated?

This is how senior marketers think. Not "Which framework should I use?" but "Which layer is broken?"

## Summary Table: The 5 Core Marketing Mental Models

| # | Mental Model | Core Question It Answers | What It Governs | Typical Failure When Ignored |
|---|--------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------|
| 1 | Human Reality | Why would a human act or not act? | Psychology, emotion, risk, trust, bias, attention | People understand but do nothing |
| 2 | Perception & Positioning | What does the buyer think this is? | Category, differentiation, comparison, framing | You compete on price or features |
| 3 | Value Translation | Do they instantly get why this matters? | Messaging, clarity, relevance, objection handling | Traffic without conversion |
| 4 | Friction & Momentum | Where does energy drop in the journey? | UX, onboarding, funnels, activation, retention | Drop-offs, churn, stalled growth |
| 5 | Distribution & Scale | How does this grow without brute force? | Channels, loops, leverage, compounding | Growth dies when effort stops |

## 30 Foundational Principles of Modern Marketing

### Human Reality Layer

| # | Principle | Core Idea | Strategic Application |
|---|-----------|-----------|----------------------|
| 1 | Attention | No persuasion happens without attention | Win attention first with relevance before asking for understanding |
| 2 | Perception | Buyers act on belief, not reality | Shape the mental frame before improving the product |
| 3 | Loss Aversion | Avoiding loss motivates more than gaining | Frame value around what is at risk if nothing changes |
| 4 | Familiarity | Familiar feels safer than better | Build repeated exposure before pushing conversion |
| 5 | Social Proof | People follow what others validate | Show credible proof early, not buried at the bottom |
| 6 | Authority | Credibility shortcuts trust | Borrow authority until you build your own |
| 7 | Trust | Trust compounds slowly, collapses fast | Protect trust more than growth metrics |

### Perception & Positioning Layer

| # | Principle | Core Idea | Strategic Application |
|---|-----------|-----------|----------------------|
| 8 | Category | You are compared unless you define the category | Define or narrow a category you can realistically win |
| 9 | Differentiation | Blending in creates invisibility | Differentiate on meaning, not features |
| 10 | Focus | Narrow wins before broad | Win a small market before expanding |
| 11 | Consistency | Repetition builds recognition | Standardize before scaling |

### Value Translation Layer

| # | Principle | Core Idea | Strategic Application |
|---|-----------|-----------|----------------------|
| 12 | Clarity | Clear beats clever every time | Optimize for understanding before optimization |
| 13 | Relevance | Right message, right moment, right person | Segment by context, not demographics alone |
| 14 | Context | Environment changes meaning | Adapt messaging to channel context |
| 15 | Objections | Unanswered doubt kills conversion | Surface and answer objections proactively |
| 16 | Story | Narratives outperform facts | Frame value through transformation |

### Friction & Momentum Layer

| # | Principle | Core Idea | Strategic Application |
|---|-----------|-----------|----------------------|
| 17 | Simplicity | Ease increases choice | Remove steps before optimizing them |
| 18 | Momentum | Action reinforces action | Design early momentum into the experience |
| 19 | Proof of Value | Experience beats explanation | Let users experience value early |
| 20 | Commitment | Small yeses lead to big yeses | Break large actions into small steps |
| 21 | Retention | Keeping users multiplies growth | Fix retention before scaling acquisition |
| 22 | Focused Metrics | Measurement shapes behavior | Measure what moves behavior |

### Distribution & Scale Layer

| # | Principle | Core Idea | Strategic Application |
|---|-----------|-----------|----------------------|
| 23 | Timing | Demand matters more than persuasion | Align campaigns with buyer readiness |
| 24 | Distribution | Visibility beats superiority | Design distribution into the product |
| 25 | Saturation | Every channel crowds over time | Diversify channels before saturation hits |
| 26 | Leverage | Systems outperform effort | Invest in systems, not hacks |
| 27 | Compounding | Small gains stack over time | Optimize for long-term advantage |
| 28 | Fit | Channels must match buyer behavior | Match channels to buyer behavior |
| 29 | Proof Over Promise | Evidence beats claims | Show, do not tell |
| 30 | Alignment | Consistency across teams builds trust | Align teams around a single narrative |
