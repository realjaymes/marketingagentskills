### FunnelEnvy - Engagement Summary

**Challenge:**
FunnelEnvy needed someone to manage their Growth, GTM, and Demand Gen projects to generate qualified leads for their services. They also required a Product Marketing Manager to oversee Reform's PLG and product marketing initiatives post-acquisition, driving its repositioning and using Reform as a strategic lead acquisition tool for FunnelEnvy's broader Revenue Funnel Optimization services.

**Solution:**
I implemented structured demand gen campaigns, an experimentation framework, and multi-brand measurement systems, while managing Reform's PLG funnel, repositioning, lifecycle automation, and GTM & product launches to align both brands strategically.

**Results:**
I achieved a consistent flow of qualified enterprise leads, stronger market positioning for FunnelEnvy, and improved Reform's trial adoption, paid conversions, and role as a pipeline driver.

**Testimonial:**
"James brought clarity and execution to our growth and product marketing efforts, helping FunnelEnvy and Reform scale pipeline impact post-acquisition. His MIA newsletter was also the perfect platform to introduce Reform to non-technical growth marketers and gather valuable product feedback." - Arun Sivashankaran, CEO, FunnelEnvy
