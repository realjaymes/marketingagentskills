## The 5-Layer Mental Model

All marketing laws collapse into five layers. When ad creative fails, it breaks at one of these layers.

| # | Layer | Core Question | What It Governs | Ad Creative Impact |
|---|-------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Human Reality (Psychology) | Why would a human act? | Emotion, trust, bias, attention | Hook, pain point, urgency |
| 2 | Perception & Positioning | What does the buyer think this is? | Category, differentiation, framing | Angle selection, competitive positioning |
| 3 | Value Translation (Messaging) | Do they instantly get why this matters? | Clarity, relevance, objection handling | Headline copy, benefit statements |
| 4 | Friction & Momentum (Conversion) | Where does energy drop? | UX, funnels, activation | CTA, offer clarity, simplicity |
| 5 | Distribution & Scale (Market) | How does this grow? | Channels, loops, leverage | Platform fit, format optimization |

**Diagnostic sequence for underperforming ads:**
1. Is this fighting human psychology? (wrong emotion, no attention grab)
2. Is the positioning unclear? (audience doesn't know what category this fits)
3. Is the value poorly translated? (features not benefits, unclear outcome)
4. Is friction killing momentum? (bad CTA, too many steps, unclear offer)
5. Is distribution mismatched? (wrong platform, wrong format, wrong audience)

## 30 Core Marketing Principles

### Layer 1: Human Reality (Psychology)

#### 1. Principle of Attention
**Principle:** You cannot persuade someone who is not paying attention.

**In ad creative:** The hook is everything. If the first line of copy or first 3 seconds of video don't break the pattern, nothing else matters. Lead with the most unexpected, specific, or emotionally charged element.

**Maps to:** Hook

---

#### 2. Principle of Perception
**Principle:** Marketing is not about what you build, but what people believe you built.

**In ad creative:** Frame the product through the lens the buyer already uses. Shape how they categorize you before they compare features. A headline that repositions beats a headline that describes.

**Maps to:** Hook, Value

---

#### 4. Principle of Loss Aversion
**Principle:** People are more motivated to avoid loss than to achieve gain.

**In ad creative:** "Don't miss out" outperforms "Get more." Frame the cost of inaction. Show what they lose by not acting rather than what they gain by acting.

**Maps to:** Pain Point, Urgency

---

#### 5. Principle of Familiarity
**Principle:** People prefer what feels familiar over what is objectively better.

**In ad creative:** Use language patterns, visual styles, and references your audience already recognizes. Brand logos increase conversion even without explanation. For new brands, borrow familiar frames.

**Maps to:** Proof, Hook

---

#### 6. Principle of Social Proof
**Principle:** People look to others to decide what is safe and correct.

**In ad creative:** Numbers beat adjectives. "10,000+ teams" beats "trusted by many." Show logos, user counts, ratings, and testimonials early. Place proof near the CTA to reduce last-moment doubt.

**Maps to:** Proof

---

#### 7. Principle of Authority
**Principle:** People trust experts and institutions more than claims.

**In ad creative:** Certifications, media mentions, expert endorsements, and founder credibility all shortcut evaluation. Borrow authority until you build your own.

**Maps to:** Proof, Hook

---

#### 12. Principle of Trust
**Principle:** Trust compounds slowly and collapses quickly.

**In ad creative:** Transparent pricing, consistent brand voice, and clear policies build trust. Never overclaim. One broken promise in ad copy (clickbait that the landing page can't deliver) destroys more trust than ten good ads build.

**Maps to:** Proof, Value

---

#### 27. Principle of Proof Over Promise
**Principle:** Evidence beats claims every time.

**In ad creative:** Screenshots beat descriptions. Metrics outperform adjectives. Live demos beat pitch decks. Show, do not tell. "Cut reporting time 75%" beats "Save a lot of time."

**Maps to:** Proof, Value

---

### Layer 2: Perception & Positioning

#### 3. Principle of Category
**Principle:** If you cannot own a category, you will be compared inside one.

**In ad creative:** Define or narrow the category in your headline. "The scheduling tool for agencies" beats "A better scheduling tool." Own a space the audience can place you in.

**Maps to:** Hook, Value

---

#### 13. Principle of Differentiation
**Principle:** If you are not different, you are invisible.

**In ad creative:** Every ad competes with every other ad in the feed. Differentiate on meaning, not features. The ad itself must look, sound, and feel different from what surrounds it.

**Maps to:** Hook, Value

---

#### 14. Principle of Focus
**Principle:** Trying to appeal to everyone weakens appeal to anyone.

**In ad creative:** One message per ad. One audience per ad set. Narrow messaging converts better than broad messaging. Call out the specific person the ad is for.

**Maps to:** Hook, Pain Point

---

#### 17. Principle of Consistency
**Principle:** Consistency builds recognition and trust over time.

**In ad creative:** Brand consistency improves recall. Repeated creative themes build familiarity across touchpoints. The ad should feel like it belongs to the same brand the landing page represents.

**Maps to:** Proof, Value

---

### Layer 3: Value Translation (Messaging)

#### 8. Principle of Clarity
**Principle:** Clear messaging beats persuasive messaging.

**In ad creative:** Simple headlines outperform clever copy. If a stranger can't understand why this matters in under five seconds, the ad fails. Remove jargon. Remove ambiguity. Lead with the outcome.

**Maps to:** Value, CTA

---

#### 9. Principle of Relevance
**Principle:** Marketing works only when it speaks to the right person at the right moment.

**In ad creative:** Segment by context, not demographics alone. Intent-based ads outperform broad targeting. Match the ad's message to the audience's stage of awareness.

**Maps to:** Pain Point, Value

---

#### 15. Principle of Context
**Principle:** The same message performs differently in different environments.

**In ad creative:** LinkedIn ad copy differs from TikTok ad copy even for the same product. Adapt tone, length, and format to where the audience sees the ad. Platform norms are not optional.

**Maps to:** Platform Fit

---

#### 20. Principle of Objections
**Principle:** Unaddressed objections silently kill conversion.

**In ad creative:** Surface and answer the top 1-2 objections in the ad itself. "No credit card required," "Free forever for small teams," "Cancel anytime" are not afterthoughts. They are conversion levers.

**Maps to:** Value, CTA

---

#### 26. Principle of Story
**Principle:** Stories are remembered longer than facts.

**In ad creative:** Before-and-after narratives convert. Customer stories sell outcomes. Frame value through transformation, not features. "How [customer] went from X to Y" beats a feature list.

**Maps to:** Hook, Pain Point, Value

---

### Layer 4: Friction & Momentum (Conversion)

#### 10. Principle of Simplicity
**Principle:** The easier something feels, the more likely it is to be chosen.

**In ad creative:** Fewer words, clearer CTA, simpler offer. Remove every word that doesn't earn its place. One-click checkout messaging improves conversions. "Start free" beats "Sign up for our free trial plan."

**Maps to:** CTA, Offer

---

#### 11. Principle of Momentum
**Principle:** Action creates more action.

**In ad creative:** Design the CTA to feel like a small, easy next step. Quick wins in the ad experience (value in the first line, clarity in the headline) build momentum toward the click.

**Maps to:** CTA

---

#### 18. Principle of Proof of Value
**Principle:** People believe what they experience more than what they are told.

**In ad creative:** Demonstrate, don't describe. Show the product in action. Screen recordings, before/after visuals, and quick walkthroughs outperform text claims.

**Maps to:** Value, Proof

---

#### 19. Principle of Commitment
**Principle:** Small commitments lead to bigger commitments.

**In ad creative:** Ask for the smallest possible next step. "Watch a 60-second demo" converts better than "Schedule a call." Micro-conversions increase final conversion. Step-by-step CTAs outperform big asks.

**Maps to:** CTA, Offer

---

#### 24. Principle of Retention
**Principle:** Retention multiplies acquisition.

**In ad creative:** For retargeting and lifecycle ads, remind users of the value they've already experienced. Lifecycle emails and in-app nudges outperform cold acquisition for expansion.

**Maps to:** Value, Urgency

---

#### 29. Principle of Focused Metrics
**Principle:** What you measure shapes what you build.

**In ad creative:** Track the right metric per ad type. Brand awareness ads optimize for reach and recall, not CTR. Conversion ads optimize for CPA, not impressions. Match creative goals to measurement.

**Maps to:** (Iteration/testing)

---

### Layer 5: Distribution & Scale (Market)

#### 16. Principle of Timing
**Principle:** Marketing works best when demand already exists.

**In ad creative:** Search ads outperform cold ads because intent exists. Seasonal campaigns outperform off-cycle ones. Align ad creative with buyer readiness and market timing.

**Maps to:** Pain Point, Urgency

---

#### 21. Principle of Distribution
**Principle:** The best product loses without effective distribution.

**In ad creative:** Platforms reward native formats. Design ads that feel native to the platform, not repurposed from another channel.

**Maps to:** Platform Fit

---

#### 22. Principle of Saturation
**Principle:** Every channel eventually becomes crowded.

**In ad creative:** Creative fatigue is real. Rotate angles, refresh visuals, and test new formats before performance declines. Early movers on new ad formats gain cost advantage.

**Maps to:** (Iteration/testing)

---

#### 23. Principle of Leverage
**Principle:** Some actions produce disproportionate results.

**In ad creative:** One winning angle scaled across variations produces more value than ten untested angles. Find what works, then systematically extend it.

**Maps to:** (Iteration/testing)

---

#### 25. Principle of Compounding
**Principle:** Small consistent gains outperform big one-time wins.

**In ad creative:** Weekly iteration cycles compound performance. Small copy tweaks tested consistently beat occasional complete rewrites.

**Maps to:** (Iteration/testing)

---

#### 28. Principle of Fit
**Principle:** Not every channel fits every product.

**In ad creative:** B2B SaaS performs better on LinkedIn than Instagram. Developer tools grow via communities. Match ad format and platform to where your buyers actually are.

**Maps to:** Platform Fit

---

#### 30. Principle of Alignment
**Principle:** Marketing works best when product, sales, and messaging align.

**In ad creative:** The ad promise must match the landing page experience. Sales decks should echo ad messaging. Inconsistency between ad and destination destroys trust and conversion.

**Maps to:** Value, Proof

Quick reference: which principles strengthen which ad elements.

| Ad Element | Primary Principles | What to Check |
|------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Hook** | Attention, Differentiation, Focus, Category, Story | Does it stop the scroll? Is it specific? Does it earn the next line? |
| **Pain Point** | Loss Aversion, Relevance, Timing, Focus | Does it name a real, felt pain? Is it specific to this audience? |
| **Value / Proof** | Clarity, Social Proof, Authority, Proof Over Promise, Story, Trust, Proof of Value | Is the benefit clear? Is there evidence? Show, not tell? |
| **Offer** | Simplicity, Commitment, Proof of Value, Objections | Is it clear what they get? Is the ask small? Are objections addressed? |
| **Urgency** | Loss Aversion, Timing | Is there a genuine reason to act now? Is it specific, not manufactured? |
| **CTA** | Momentum, Commitment, Simplicity, Context | Is the next step obvious? Low friction? Platform-appropriate? |
| **Platform Fit** | Context, Distribution, Fit | Does it feel native? Right format? Right tone for the platform? |
