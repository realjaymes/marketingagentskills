## Video Ad Script Framework (Paid)

For short, high-performing ad videos across TikTok, Meta (IG/FB), and YouTube Shorts. Purpose: grab attention fast, connect emotionally, demonstrate value, and drive a clear action within 15-60 seconds.

### 5-Part Structure

| Section | Timing | Purpose | What to Do |
|---------|--------|---------|------------|
| **1. Hook** | 0-3s | Stop the scroll | Pattern-interrupt. Use one of the 10 hook techniques below. No intros or warmups. |
| **2. Relatability / Pain Point** | 3-10s | Build emotional connection | Name a pain they already feel. Show empathy. Make them feel seen before pitching. |
| **3. Value / Demonstration** | 10-25s | Prove the point | Show the solution in action. Use screen recordings, before/after, social proof. Demonstrate, don't describe. |
| **4. Offer / Urgency** | 25-45s | Create desire | Position the offer as a shortcut. Add a genuine urgency trigger. Reinforce simplicity. Highlight benefits, not features. |
| **5. CTA** | 45-60s | Direct action | Connect back to core message. Keep tone consistent with the rest of the ad. Be specific. |

### Adapting for Different Lengths

| Length | What Changes |
|--------|-------------|
| **15 seconds** | Hook (0-3s) → Value + Proof (3-10s) → CTA (10-15s). Compress Pain + Value into one beat. |
| **30 seconds** | Hook (0-3s) → Pain (3-8s) → Value/Proof (8-20s) → Offer + CTA (20-30s). Merge Urgency into CTA. |
| **45-60 seconds** | Full 5-part structure as described above. |

## 10 Hook Techniques

Each hook technique with ad-specific examples.

### 1. Controversial / Polarizing
Challenge an assumption to trigger emotional engagement.

> "You don't need another marketing course. You need templates that actually get work done."

### 2. Visually Intriguing
Start with an unexpected or bold visual action. Curiosity through action beats any spoken line.

> Deleting a marketing spreadsheet, dragging multiple Notion tabs into one, showing an AI prompt turning into a full campaign plan.

### 3. Relatable Frustration
Connect instantly with shared pain or struggle.

> "If you've ever spent hours building a marketing plan from scratch, this is for you."

### 4. Mid-Story (Drop Into the Moment)
Open with tension and intrigue, pulling viewers in.

> "At 2AM, I realized my campaign failed because I didn't have a proper framework. So I built one."

### 5. Bold Prediction / Promise
Combine curiosity with a clear payoff.

> "In 60 seconds, you'll know how to plan your next product launch using just one Notion template."

### 6. Ask a Question
Trigger internal dialogue.

> "What if you could plan, launch, and track every campaign without opening Excel?"

### 7. Share a Fact
Lead with a surprising or compelling statistic.

> "Marketers waste an average of 6 hours a week building reports manually. One template could do it automatically."

### 8. Offer a Transformation
Show the before-and-after journey.

> "I used to spend days writing prompts that made no sense. Now, every AI tool I use writes like a strategist."

### 9. Give a Tip Right from the Start
Deliver immediate value to earn attention.

> "Here's how to use one AI prompt to turn your product features into high-converting ad copy."

### 10. Show Enticing B-Roll
Open with captivating visuals before speaking.

> Scrolling through a Notion workspace, a template library, a ChatGPT window generating a marketing plan live.

## Relatability & Pain Point Techniques

After the hook, deepen the emotional connection. The viewer should feel understood before you pitch anything.

**Approaches:**
- **Show empathy:** "If you're constantly building campaigns, dashboards, or reports from scratch, I know how exhausting that is."
- **Reflect their reality:** "Every marketer hits that point where you realize theory isn't your problem. Execution is."
- **Anchor in authenticity:** "I built MIA because I was tired of hunting for good templates that didn't exist. So I made them myself."

**Rule:** Make the viewer feel *seen* before you ever pitch a solution.

---

## Value / Demonstration Techniques

Show or explain the solution in action.

- **Demonstrate** what you're offering, don't just describe it
- Use **screen recordings**, **before/after visuals**, or quick steps
- **Add social proof** naturally:
  - "We've helped 1,000+ marketers do this."
  - "Here's what happened when I tried it."
  - "This is what people are saying..." (overlay testimonials or reactions)
- **Reinforce value:** "You're not buying templates. You're buying back your time."

---

## Offer & Urgency Techniques

Give them a reason to act now.

**Framing approaches:**
- **Position as shortcut:** "Instead of spending hours designing frameworks, you get 50+ ready-to-use templates, updated every month."
- **Add urgency trigger:** "You can get 20% off when you subscribe now. The discount ends this week."
- **Reinforce simplicity:** "All you need is a Google account or Notion. Everything else is done for you."
- **Make it feel like access, not a sale:** "This isn't a course. It's a toolkit you can open, copy, and start using right now."

## Organic Video Scripting Framework

For organic (non-paid) social media video content. Simpler 3-part structure.

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Hook** | Grab attention. Same 10 techniques apply. |
| **Narrative / Value** | Take the viewer on a journey from problem to resolution. Be relatable. Cut anything that doesn't serve the core idea. |
| **CTA** | Direct or implied. Sometimes the value itself drives action without an explicit ask. |

**Key principles for organic:**
- Ask yourself repeatedly: "What do I want them to remember?"
- Cut mercilessly. Remove anything that doesn't serve the core idea.
- The CTA should connect to the central idea, not feel bolted on.
- Make it feel effortless for the consumer (it takes effort to achieve that).

## Production Tips

| Element | Guidance |
|---------|----------|
| **Sound** | Use upbeat music or trending audios. Layer subtle clicks and typing sounds over screen recordings. |
| **Visuals** | Film from your workspace, dashboard, or product screens for authenticity. |
| **Text overlay** | Always include captions. 85% of users watch on mute. |
| **Repetition** | Repeat the offer or key phrase at least once (e.g. "Put marketing into action" / "Save hours. Execute faster."). |
| **Format** | Vertical 9:16, high contrast text, clear/warm lighting. |
| **Length** | 15-30 seconds for TikTok/IG Reels. 45-60 for YouTube Shorts. |
