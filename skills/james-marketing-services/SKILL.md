## Cold Email Framework

### Purpose
A cold email is not a pitch. It is an invitation to evaluate a mutual trade.

Before writing, clarify:
- **For you**: What do you want from this role or team?
- **For them**: What concrete problem can you help solve?

- What you want: A conversation about a role, contract engagement, or trial collaboration
- Why it helps them: How your experience reduces risk or accelerates outcomes

**Principle 3: Be Transparent About Your Self-Interest**
Openly explain:
- Why this role matters to you
- How it aligns with your longer-term trajectory

**Principle 4: Show Real Effort Beyond the Email**
Include:
- A short teardown of their website or onboarding flow
- A brief GTM or messaging note based on their current positioning
- A one-page outline of how you would approach their funnel in the first 60 days

### Intent Signals for Outreach

**Signal 1: Hiring for Marketing/Growth/Product Marketing Roles**
- Open job postings on LinkedIn for contract, part time, & temporary remote roles
- Expanding Product Marketing, Growth Marketing, Demand Generation roles

**Signal 2: Receiving Funding or Entering New Markets**
- Companies listed on YCombinator's company list
- Announcing seed, Series A/B funding, or expansion into new regions
- Increasing marketing spend or PR activities post-funding
